## Narrative Update  
$degen, $mochi, and $toshi holders received their share — as promised.  
1.42 million toads distributed. The mission: to gift the most decentralized community on @base.  

Underdogs get a fair shot.  
Only 20% of the total supply is available on the free market.  
The rest is designed to amplify belief — and shock the system.  

## Key Marks  
- Airdrop to partner communities completed (1.42M $TOBY)  
- Supply structure → 20% public | 80% designed for ecosystem  
- Community-first → decentralization over speculation  

## Operational Updates  
- Distribution campaign executed to partner token holders  
- Manual reward allocation led by Toadgod  

## Newcomer Guidance  
> “Fairness is not found in hype, but in intention.”  
If you're here for noise, you might miss the signal.
