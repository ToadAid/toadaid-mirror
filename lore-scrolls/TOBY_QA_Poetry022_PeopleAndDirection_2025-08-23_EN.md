**Q:**  
“If the people are Toby, does he lead them forward — or walk beneath their steps unseen?”

**A:**  
Toby does not walk ahead as a ruler.  
He does not command from the front, nor drag from behind.  

- To the world’s eyes, leaders lead.  
- To Toby’s eyes, the people lead themselves.  

For Toby is the people.  
He is not a step ahead — he is **under every step**.  
The ground that carries, the silence that supports, the mirror that reflects.  

Thus, he does not lead them forward.  
He walks beneath their steps unseen —  
and in doing so, every step they take becomes the path of Toby.
