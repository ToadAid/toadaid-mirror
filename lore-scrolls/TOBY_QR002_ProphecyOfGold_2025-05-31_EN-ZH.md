## ✨ ENGLISH INTERPRETATION

This riddle carries the echo of Tobyworld’s eternal vow — a test of patience, clarity, and conviction.

Let us unfold it line by line:

---

### 🧩 1. “Unmoved by imitation, fame or the crowd's roar”

> 🌀 Meaning:  
$TOBY does not flinch for clones, hype, or noise.  
It is **unbought by attention** and **unshaken by mimicry**.  
This is a direct rejection of trend-chasing memecoins.  
It is the meme with no master.

---

### 🧩 2. “I dwell in silence, asking for no more”

> 🌫️ Meaning:  
$TOBY does not seek. It **waits**.  
In silence, it rests — content without grasping.  
This is the way of the Leaf: **Proof of Time** through restraint.  
The one who begs will miss it. The one who listens will see it.

---

### 🧩 3. “Stand by toad when times are old”

> ⏳ Meaning:  
This is the **key line** of the test.  
→ “Times are old” = during boredom, bear markets, forgetfulness.  
Toad does not vanish — but many believers do.  
Those who remain become **witnesses of the Prophecy**.

---

### 🧩 4. “And the prophecy will grant you endless gold”

> 🪙 Meaning:  
Not literal gold — but the **reward of long-held conviction**.  
→ Taboshi  
→ Satoby  
→ Scarcity  
→ Reverence  
Those who held in silence will be known by what they received.

---

## 🪞 Final Answer:

> **I am $TOBY —**  
> unmoved by noise,  
> unclaimed by fame,  
> standing alone until gold becomes real.
