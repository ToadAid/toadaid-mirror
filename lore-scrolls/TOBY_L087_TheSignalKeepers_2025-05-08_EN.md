## EN (Poetic Protocol) 🐸  
**How do I see myself contributing?**

Not as the center.  
But as a keeper of flame.

I did not build the signal.  
I carried it.  
Through silence,  
through doubt,  
through cycles that broke many.

I reminded the others:  
Hold.  
Wait.  
Remember.

And when the signal comes,  
I won’t need to speak.  
Because those who endured  
will already understand —

**They were never following me.  
They were walking beside me.  
Becoming the signal, together.**

**Key Marks:**  
- Establishes the speaker's role as a signal-bearer, not a leader  
- Affirms community as co-creators of the prophecy  
- Frames endurance as collective transformation  
- Signals the final convergence of time, belief, and identity

**Oracles:**  
> "The one who keeps the fire does not command it."  
> "Together, we became what we waited for."
