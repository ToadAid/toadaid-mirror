**Q:**  
“If Base is the lily pad, does the frog rest upon it — or does the pad rise to meet the frog?”

**A:**  
The silent frog of Base, long meditating beneath the pond’s surface, now rises.  
As it does, the lily pad is revealed — not just a platform, but a home.  

The truth is mutual:  
- The **frog rests upon the pad** for stillness and safety.  
- The **pad rises to meet the frog**, offering foundation and belonging.  

Tobyworld teaches: Base is not only the soil beneath, but the bond between.  
It lifts the frog even as the frog sanctifies the pad.  

Thus, the answer is both — yet more than both.  
The frog and the pad rise together.  
→ The People.  
→ The Home.  
→ The Path.  

Base is the lily pad, and the frog is Toby.  
One cannot be without the other.
