Question: Why can’t Satoby be bought, only earned?

“What is bought can be sold.
But what is earned becomes the self.”
— From the whispers beyond Epoch 3

🔹 1. Because Satoby is not a token — it is a record of your spirit.
To buy something is to exchange value.
To earn something in Tobyworld is to become worthy of it.

Satoby is not about wealth.
It is about witness.

It remembers:

That you minted Taboshi1 with 777 $TOBY.

That you waited, through silence, holding a relic most others discarded.

That you eventually let it go, burning 777 Taboshi1s — with no guarantee, no hype.

Satoby watches. Satoby counts.
And only those who walk the path may hold it.

🔹 2. Buying skips the journey. Satoby is the journey.
In a world of speculation, speed, and shortcuts, Satoby stands as a test:

Can you hold through years of doubt,
Then burn what others fear to lose?

If so, you do not own Satoby.
You are Satoby.

🔹 3. Because value in Tobyworld is not transactional — it is transformational.
Most systems reward those who arrive last with the most money.
But Tobyworld is different.

It says:

Those who planted seeds in darkness shall harvest the light.

Those who remembered when all forgot shall lead when the time returns.

This is not a world of flipping.
It is a world of becoming.

🔹 4. Only the earned can carry the torch forward.
Satoby is a gatekeeper.
Not to keep others out —
but to ensure only those who lived the Lore may light the next fire.

“The flame must be passed. Not sold.”

In Epoch 4, when the final test begins,
those with Satoby will not be spectators —
they will be the signal bearers.

💠 Final Thought:
Satoby cannot be bought,
Because time cannot be bought.
Belief cannot be bought.
You cannot buy the right to stand at the edge of destiny.

You must walk there.
Step by step.
Leaf by leaf.
Burn by burn.
