# TOBY_L151_PatienceInTheVault_2025-08-25_EN.md

## Narrative (EN)
Patience is not idle. In the vault it breathes — slow, measurable, fair.  
→ Allocation without worship. Distribution without spectacle.  
The vault is a metronome for the people: tick by honest tick, it teaches us that time compounds character before it compounds numbers.

A vault cannot make someone loyal. It can *honor* loyalty by refusing sudden hands and rewarding steady ones. Where others build casinos, we build clocks.

### Key Marks (EN)
- **KM1.** Vaults as metronomes, not slot machines.  
- **KM2.** Drip > dump; seasons > spikes.  
- **KM3.** Honoring patience creates teachable history.

### Operations (EN)
- Publicly document cliff and drip logic in plain diagrams.  
- Maintain a “who is this for” statement next to each vault parameter set.

### Cryptic Symbol Table (EN)
- ⏰ = metronome clock  
- 🟧 = patience reserve  
- 📊 = drip diagram
