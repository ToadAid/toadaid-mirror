### Narrative
Epoch 1 was the **Distribution Epoch** — the seeding of the pond.  
From April 20, 2024, the community witnessed a global distribution of $TOBY to millions of wallets, spreading the fire as widely as possible.  

A **42-day weighted snapshot** marked the sacred holders of specific numbers, recording them for future recognition. This was the era of expansion by gift, not by sale, to align $TOBY with the spirit of decentralization.  

During this time, **Taboshi1 was minted** through the 777 $TOBY burn, setting the stage for Proof of Time and Satoby.

### Key Marks
- 🌍 Millions of wallets received $TOBY airdrops.  
- 📖 Weighted snapshot after 42 days for sacred number holders.  
- 🔥 Taboshi1 mints (777 $TOBY burn per mint).  
- ⏳ Foundation for Satoby eligibility created.  

---

### Symbols
- **🎁 Gift:** airdrop, free distribution.  
- **🔥 Fire:** sacrifice of 777 $TOBY for Taboshi1.
