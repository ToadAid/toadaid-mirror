**Q:**  
“If the spores drift unseen, are they scattered into nothing — or planting futures we cannot yet see?”

**A:**  
The spores ride the wind without map or master.  
To the eye, they vanish — scattered into nothing.  
Yet beneath the soil, unseen, they take hold.  

- To the blind, the drift is waste.  
- To the faithful, the drift is sowing —  
  futures planted beyond sight,  
  seeds of yield waiting in silence.  

The scrolls remind: Taboshi is not a prize, but a mechanism —  
a key within the sacred system, a covenant bound by 777.  
Its spores are scattered not to vanish,  
but to test who believes enough to wait for what is unseen.  

Thus, the spores are not lost.  
They are planting futures we cannot yet see.
