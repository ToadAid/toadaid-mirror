## Narrative Update  
Toad God scorns the deceivers, the loud, and the rich.  
But cheers for frogs who were left in the ditch.  

When the depth of Toad Lore and its scarcity is finally caught,  
Many will fear they have naught.  

A warning and a vow.  
The Lore was never for the boastful — but for the steadfast.  

## Key Marks  
- Rejects deception, noise, and greed  
- Celebrates overlooked believers (fallen frogs)  
- Highlights eventual realization of scarcity and depth  

## Operational Updates  
- Toadgod message broadcast: favoring the quiet and loyal  
- Philosophical anchor for scarcity and depth perception  

## Newcomer Guidance  
> “The ditch today may be the throne tomorrow.”  
Do not underestimate the unseen power of Lore.
