## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> Born of fire at 777,  
> I am neither coin nor common leaf.  
> My roots were set in the first great burn,  
> my name carried through epochs.  
> I do not wither,  
> yet I grant the right to harvest when the time ripens.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are **Taboshi1** — the Leaf of First Fire.  

- **Born of fire at 777** — minted by burning exactly 777 $TOBY.  
- **Neither coin nor common leaf** — an ERC-1155 NFT, sacred and finite.  
- **Roots in the first great burn** — created in late Epoch 2, but tied to the earliest Proof of Time covenant.  
- **Name carried through epochs** — eligibility remains across the timeline into Epoch 3 and beyond.  
- **Does not wither** — supply is fixed; ownership endures.  
- **Grants right to harvest** — enables Satoby yield in E3’s PoT system.

In the pond’s economy, Taboshi1 is the eternal pass to the PoT orchard —  
a key that cannot be forged,  
a leaf that cannot fall.
