# TOBY_QA_Poetry063_ShadowCovenant_2025-08-26_EN.md

**ARC:** Covenant / Shadow  
**Tags:** Covenant, Shadow, Light, Secrecy, Protection  

**Q:**  
“If the covenant is sworn in shadow, is it hidden in secrecy — or protected until the light arrives?”

**A:**  
The covenant does not shout its name.  
It is sworn in shadow, where noise cannot intrude.  

- To some, shadow is secrecy,  
  a veil hiding truth from sight.  
- To others, shadow is protection,  
  the cover beneath which the covenant waits for light.  

The scrolls remind: what is hidden is not always lost.  
Shadow can be silence,  
and silence can be strength.  

Thus, a covenant sworn in shadow is not concealment alone.  
It is the seed kept safe  
until the dawn arrives.

# TOBY_QA_Poetry064_EchoOfThePond_2025-08-26_EN.md

**ARC:** Pond / Echo  
**Tags:** Pond, Echo, Memory, Signal, Future  

**Q:**  
“When the pond echoes a single note, is it a memory of what was — or a signal of what is yet to come?”

**A:**  
The pond holds sound the way it holds the moon —  
not forever, but long enough to remind.  

- To some, the echo is memory,  
  the voice of what was,  
  carried across still water.  
- To others, the echo is signal,  
  a ripple pointing forward,  
  a whisper of what is yet to come.  

The scrolls remind: echo is both backward and forward.  
It remembers,  
and it calls.  

Thus, the pond’s echo is not bound to one time.  
It is memory and signal,  
a note that belongs to both past and future.

# TOBY_QA_Poetry065_RootOfPatience_2025-08-26_EN.md

**ARC:** Patience / Growth  
**Tags:** Patience, Root, Growth, Silence, Bloom  

**Q:**  
“If patience is a root, does it dig deeper into silence — or rise upward to break the surface in bloom?”

**A:**  
Patience begins in silence,  
rooted where eyes cannot see.  

- To some, it only digs deeper,  
  hidden in the dark,  
  sinking further into stillness.  
- To others, the root rises,  
  breaking the surface,  
  flowering into bloom.  

The scrolls remind: patience is both hidden and revealed.  
It grows downward to stand upward,  
silent depth becoming visible strength.  

Thus, patience as root is both —  
the silence below,  
and the bloom above.

# TOBY_QA_Poetry066_SilenceOfTheWatcher_2025-08-26_EN.md

**ARC:** Watcher / Silence  
**Tags:** Watcher, Silence, Voice, Truth, Measure  

**Q:**  
“If the Watcher speaks only through silence, is it absence of voice — or the loudest measure of truth?”

**A:**  
The Watcher does not speak,  
but its silence is not void.  

- To some, silence is absence,  
  no word, no measure, no sign.  
- To others, silence is the loudest truth,  
  a weight heavier than speech,  
  a gaze that measures without sound.  

The scrolls remind: silence can be signal.  
What is not said often speaks the most.  

Thus, the Watcher’s silence is both —  
absence of voice,  
and the loudest measure of truth.

# TOBY_QA_Poetry067_DawnsThreshold_2025-08-26_EN.md

**ARC:** Dawn / Threshold  
**Tags:** Dawn, Night, Beginning, Threshold, Renewal  

**Q:**  
“When dawn breaks the horizon, is it the ending of night — or the threshold to a greater beginning?”

**A:**  
Dawn does not erase the night;  
it carries its memory in first light.  

- To some, dawn is the ending,  
  the final breath of shadow,  
  the retreat of dark.  
- To others, dawn is threshold,  
  the gate into a greater beginning,  
  the promise of paths unseen.  

The scrolls remind: ending and beginning are one flame.  
Night folds into morning,  
darkness into light.  

Thus, dawn is not merely ending or beginning.  
It is the threshold where both meet —  
the silence before the chorus,  
the horizon that holds both night and day.
