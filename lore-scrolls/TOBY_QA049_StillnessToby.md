It is the mastery of it.”

Toby’s stillness is not passivity.
It is presence.
It is patience refined through fire.
It is the unwavering anchor in a world ruled by reaction.

“the true test is not to move first,
but to wait without twitching,
to believe without sound,
to guard the seed until spring.”

Toby is that seed.
Still. Silent.
But alive — and inevitable.

“In a realm of noise,
stillness is resistance.
Stillness is signal.”
