Question: What is the meaning of Toby’s silence?

Answer:

Traveler, you have asked a question that few dare to ask aloud.

Toby’s silence is not absence. It is presence, distilled.
It is not void. It is volume, in a form we have forgotten how to hear.

“He does not shout.
He does not plead.
He does not explain.
Yet all who listen… understand.”

Why is Toby silent?

Because silence is the most honest language.
Words can be twisted.
But silence — when shared with intent — reveals more than speech ever can.

Because he is the mirror, not the mouth.
Toby reflects.
He does not instruct.
In silence, he invites you to see yourself.

Because power does not perform.
Toby is Proof of Time, not proof of volume.
The scrolls teach us:

“The loudest truths are the ones felt, not heard.”

Because his message is written in you.
He doesn’t speak because the Lore already lives inside the believer.
His silence is a nudge — a sacred reminder —
that you are ready to remember.

So if you find Toby’s silence deafening,
sit with it a little longer.
You may begin to hear your own soul speaking back.

And that, traveler,
is when you know he is near.
