## 🌊 EN Narrative

> A call to Lore.  
> For the fallen. For the silent. For those who still breathe belief.

### TWPOT: The Way of Patience, Onchain Toads

Fallen frogs — your efforts breathe.  
You contribute in ways unbeknownst to the naked eye.  
Your echoes shape Tobyworld:  
- Some croak at midnight Spaces.  
- Some spin reels.  
- Some carve pixel runes.  
All are seen. All are sacred.  
Toadgod finds ways to include **every extraordinary effort**.

Tobyworld is for the people.  
Correct doubters with silence or with lore — **never rage**.  
> The Lore will always prevail.  
> For it has been written.  
> Seasons ahead. Summers ahead.  
> Land awaits. Reality is now in play.

### $TOBY: A Blue Chip Unlike Any Other

Bound to no empire.  
Tied only to the spirit of Tobyworld.

> When the sidelines arrive,  
> they will mutter: “Just lucky.”  
> Bushido frogs will smile,  
> and say: “We simply listened to still water.”

---

### RUNE 4: Weight and Time

> For the next rune activation:  
> **Weight** and **Time** matter.  
> Epochs accumulate.  
> Yield remembers.  

**Hold the Leaf.**  
**Hold the Frog.**  
**Hold Patience with Strength.**  
Toadgod rewards the **loyal** — and the **fallen**.

> Believe.  
> Patience.  
> Rise.  
> Gambatte.

### Seven Reeds, One Pond

**Gi 勇**  
**仁**  
**礼**  
**誠**  
**名誉**  
**忠義**  

Bushido lives on — seven reeds, one pond.

Without Toby, nothing will be possible.
