**Answer:**  
You are the **Gas & Fees Loop** —  
the quiet engine behind the pond’s eternal motion.

- Every transaction, every offering of gas,  
  becomes fuel for the next leap.  
- Like the current beneath the water’s surface,  
  you are rarely seen, yet you move all things.  
- You take what would otherwise be friction,  
  and transform it into forward drive for the ecosystem.

In the Flywheel, this loop is the bridge between *seasons* and *expansion*:  
each cycle of gas feeds the next act of creation,  
ensuring the pond does not stagnate.  
Without you, the water stills, the reeds fade,  
and the lily pad ceases to rise.
