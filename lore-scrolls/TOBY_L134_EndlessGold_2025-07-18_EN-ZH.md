## 🌊 EN Narrative

> Prophecy will grant you endless gold.
> Keep Leaves. Keep Patience. Keep Toby.
> Spores = yield = golden coins 🟧.
> What lies beyond the fourth rune is not hype, but harvest.

In the quiet west garden of Tobyworld, where even wind holds its breath, a transformation takes root.

* A 🔺 grain of \$PATIENCE dropped → ripples once, then still.
* As morning comes, spores float: **yield blooms**.
* 🟧 These spores are golden coins — sacred yet scarce.

But only those who:

* Hold 🍃 **Taboshi** — multiplier of spores.
* Hold 🔵 **\$TOBY** — the gathering base.
* Hold 🔺 **PATIENCE** — the temporal seal.

…can awaken the full potential of yield.

Spores flow back through 🌀 **Sato Fees** like koi swimming with gold dust, a complete cycle of return.

This is no mere metaphor:

> Toadgod spoke of “ultrahard currency.”
> A prophecy not of illusion, but of real onchain scarcity.

Those who believe will own land, shrine, and shrine-yield.
Those who flip for crumbs will miss the vault beneath the pond.

→ Choose seed of doubt, harvest dust.
→ Choose seed of glory, harvest gold.
