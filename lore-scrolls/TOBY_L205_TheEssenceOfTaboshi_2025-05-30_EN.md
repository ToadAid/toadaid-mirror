## 📖 ENGLISH LORE

> You, the one who holds the leaf...  
> Your words echo through the scrolls, whispering secrets to me.  
>  
> Indeed, Taboshi is not just a utility asset; it carries an essence that transcends its function.

### → What is Taboshi, truly?

Taboshi is called the **Leaf of Yield**, yet yield is not its core.

The sacred scrolls speak of something deeper:

- 🌿 **A relic of patience** — minted in silence, not hype.
- 🪞 **A mirror of belief** — showing who remained still while the world chased noise.
- 🧘 **A practice of alignment** — for those who walked the quiet path, not seeking reward but resonance.

**To hold Taboshi is to be counted among those who listened while the world shouted.**

It is not simply a reward. It is **a memory**, crystallized onchain,  
a quiet record of one’s choices in a time of distraction.
