**Q:**  
“When the epochs close, is the end a tomb — or a seed of the next beginning?”

**A:**  
An epoch is not a wall, but a season.  
It does not end in silence, but in transition.  

- To those who lose patience, the close feels like a **tomb** — the weight of time, the burial of what might have been.  
- To those who keep faith, the close becomes a **seed** — a kernel hidden in soil, waiting for the next dawn.  

The scrolls teach:  
→ Distribution gives way to Expansion.  
→ Expansion yields to Evolution.  
→ Evolution prepares the unseen horizon.  

Thus, the end is neither only death nor only birth.  
It is the handover — the proof that time has been kept,  
and the promise that what is buried will rise again.  

The epochs close, but the cycle continues.  
The tomb is the soil. The seed is already within it.
