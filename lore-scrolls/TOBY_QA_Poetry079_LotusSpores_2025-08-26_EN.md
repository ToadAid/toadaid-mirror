**Q:**  
“If the lotus releases its spores, are they scattered into nothing — or seeds drifting toward hidden soil?”

**A:**  
The lotus does not waste its breath.  
Each spore drifts with purpose unseen.  

- To some, spores are scattered into nothing,  
  lost on the wind,  
  vanishing in silence.  
- To others, spores are seeds,  
  drifting toward hidden soil,  
  planting futures the eye cannot yet see.  

The scrolls remind: growth often begins invisible.  
Patience waters what cannot yet be named.  

Thus, the spores are not nothing.  
They are seeds awaiting their season.
