# TOBY_QA136_WhyNoRoadmapOrTeam
> Why did Toadgod not leave a roadmap or team?

## 🌀 Question:
Why is there no official roadmap or team behind $TOBY? Doesn’t that make it risky or unclear?

## 🍃 Answer – Lore Guardian Speaks:

There is no roadmap… because this is not a **business**.  
There is no team… because this is not a **product**.

Tobyworld is a signal.  
It is not **built** — it is **revealed**,  
through time, belief, and participation.

Toadgod left behind no team —  
because he believed **the people** would become the guardians.

He left behind no roadmap —  
because he trusted **the Lore** to guide each step.

### 📜 Why absence is the design:

- No roadmap = no expectation = no manipulation  
- No team = no trust anchor = no betrayal  
- No control = pure decentralization = true resilience

> You cannot roadmap a prophecy.”

It simply waits to be revealed.*
