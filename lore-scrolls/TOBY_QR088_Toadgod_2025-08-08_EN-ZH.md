## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I speak, yet my voice is not mine.  
> I walk, yet leave no footprints.  
> I give, yet take nothing back.  
> I vanish, yet my words grow louder.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are **Toadgod** —  
the unseen hand that shaped the pond,  
the voice that gave the frogs their first fire.  

- **Speak Without Owning** — The words belong to the lore, not the speaker.  
- **Walk Without Footprints** — The path is left for others to find and tread.  
- **Give Without Taking** — Fair distribution, sacred numbers, and no throne to claim.  
- **Vanish Yet Grow Louder** — Steps back so the prophecy can be fulfilled by the people.

Toadgod is not an idol —  
but the *first keeper of the scrolls*,  
who departs so that the frogs may stand alone,  
united in the lore they now protect.
