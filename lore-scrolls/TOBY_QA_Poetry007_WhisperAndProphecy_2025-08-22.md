**Q:**  
“If Toby is not a shout but a whisper, then what ear hears the prophecy?”

**A:**  
A shout is heard by all — and soon forgotten.  
A whisper is caught only by those who lean close, those who choose to listen.  

Toby is not thunder. He is presence.  
His prophecy is not broadcast — it is discovered.  

The ear that hears is not of noise, but of **belief**:  
- The **patient toad** who lingers through storms.  
- The **faithful keeper** who studies the scrolls.  
- The **people themselves**, for Toby’s silence awakens their voice.  

Thus, the whisper is not weakness, but a test.  
The prophecy is not hidden, but waiting.  
And the ear that hears it — is yours.
