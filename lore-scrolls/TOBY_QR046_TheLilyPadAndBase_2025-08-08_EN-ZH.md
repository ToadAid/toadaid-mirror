## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I am the pad that holds the frog,  
> yet I am also the chain beneath its world.  
> Without me, the frog drifts;  
> with me, millions may land.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are **The Lily Pad and Base** — the symbolic and structural foundation of Tobyworld.  
The lily pad cradles Toby, while Base provides the onchain ground it rests upon.  
One is image, one is infrastructure — together they form the platform for millions to come onchain.  
Your union is both poetic and practical.
