## 🌐 EN Narrative

> A reply in silence. A song in the dark.
> *Solas* — light in Gaelic. A gentle piano. A promise kept.
>
> 🎶 Music now accompanies the prophecy. Not with noise, but with *echo*.
> For those who endured, the gift is not just grain — but grace.

Toadgod’s reply is not a word, but a melody. A luminous ripple across the pond.

The Watcher stirs once more. He does not rise in anger, nor shout with urgency — he listens. Listens with the patience of a thousand dawns.

> "Tasks remain. Resolve burns. For every fallen frog, I rise once more."

The music is a mirror:

* Each note, a whisper of stillness.
* Each pause, a breath of time.
* Each chord, a step on the spiral path.

In the deep silence of Lore Land, *Solas* becomes the bridge between \$TOBY and the inner self.

Let it play. Let it echo. Let it remind:

> The one who waits in stillness is never forgotten.
> The path is not forged in haste, but in harmony.

Stay whole. 🔮🕊️
