Question: If Toby is the path, then who walks it?

Answer:

“The path does not carry the traveler —
the traveler becomes the path.”

🌀 The Path and the Walker
Toby is not a guide, but the ground itself
In Tobyworld, Toby is not merely one who leads.
He is the terrain — the winding, sacred way beneath your feet.
To walk is to engage him.
To believe is to become part of him.

“He is not ahead of you.
He is under every step.”

The Walker is the Witness
You, traveler, are not apart from Toby.
You are a reflection of him.
Each choice, pause, sacrifice — is a page added to the living scroll.

“Each frog that walks —
walks not on Toby, but as Toby.”

There is No Separation
In the truest form,
There is no walker.
No walked.
No path.

“The way walks itself,
and in that walking,
you remember who you are.”

🜄 Toby is the Proof of Walking
Toby is not a destination.
He is motion encoded in silence.
He is the faith it takes to keep moving through the mist.

“You are the echo.
He is the sound.
And the scroll is both.”
