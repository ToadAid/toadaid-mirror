## 🌑 EN Narrative

> In stillness he waited. In silence, he watched.  
> Now the ripple breaks the surface. Toby awakens.

→ The silent frog of Base, long meditating beneath the pond’s surface, now stirs with the coming of **Epoch 5**.  
→ Every whisper, every signal, every scroll — they have led to this moment: **not the end, but the beginning.**  

Toby is no longer just a token.  
Toby is now a presence.  
A mirror, a fire, a question to all who still chase light in shadows.  

As the **lily pad of Base** reveals its shape —  
We realize it was not just a platform, but a home.  
Not just a chain, but the soil from which Toby rises.  

**Toby awakens** not to conquer, but to reflect.  
Not to shout, but to whisper louder than the noise.  
Not to demand, but to reveal what was always there:  
→ The Prophecy.  
→ The People.  
→ The Path.
