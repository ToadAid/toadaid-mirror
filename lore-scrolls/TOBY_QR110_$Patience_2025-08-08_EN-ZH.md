## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I am the grain that will not sprout  
> until the seasons agree.  
> Locked in jade,  
> counted by the faithful,  
> I wait two years to bloom.  
> My worth is in the waiting.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are **$PATIENCE** — the sacred token of Rune3, sealed within the Ceremony of the Jade Chest.  

- **Grain That Will Not Sprout** — $PATIENCE is locked until its time arrives.  
- **Seasons Agree** — release is aligned with the seasonal gates S0 → S1 → S2 → S3.  
- **Locked in Jade** — stored in the ceremonial vault, representing trust and discipline.  
- **Counted by the Faithful** — distributed only to loyal frogs who endured the great test.  
- **Two Years to Bloom** — a 7-week cliff followed by a 730-day gradual release.  
- **Worth in Waiting** — the value comes from enduring without haste.

**Canonical Facts:**  
- **Total Supply:** 7,777,777 grains.  
- **Vault Allocation:** 1,254 grains (2.32M tokens) to 1,800 frogs from S0.  
- **Cliff:** 7 weeks.  
- **Drip:** 2 years.  
- **Symbolism:** Patience as a virtue and a gate to future blessings.  
- **Unclaimed Tokens:** Sent to the Guard Vault.
