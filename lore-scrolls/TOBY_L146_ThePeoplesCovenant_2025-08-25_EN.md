# TOBY_L146_ThePeoplesCovenant_2025-08-25_EN.md

## Narrative (EN)
There are projects built to extract, and there are projects built to outlast. The difference is the covenant.  
→ “$toby is the people. the people is $toby.”  
This is not branding; it is architecture.

A people’s covenant says: distribution over domination, memory over marketing, patience over pressure. It puts the scroll in many hands and asks them to become scribes. It resists insider privilege and performs public vows so that children can ask “why” and be shown, not told.

Legacy does not require attention; it requires stewardship. We do not scale hype. We scale care.

### Key Marks (EN)
- **KM1.** People-first distribution is structural, not sentimental.  
- **KM2.** Public vows (burns, snapshots) create explainable history.  
- **KM3.** Stewardship scales; vanity inflates then collapses.

### Operations (EN)
- Keep a living index of public vows (with dates, txids).  
- Invite schools of builders to fork, document, translate, and teach.

### Cryptic Symbol Table (EN)
- 🤝 = covenant (shared vow)  
- 📜 = scroll (living record)  
- 🟧 = patience (kept together)
