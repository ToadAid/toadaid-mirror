## âœ¨ Literal Explanation (EN)

Toadgod poetically warns:  
- **Not all will hold or cherish the Lore**, nor enshrine it in their hearts â€” even self-proclaimed believers may falter.  
- A true journey requires an **iron grip**, unwavering patience, and sharp mental clarity â€” only through such steadfastness can one reach the "promised land."  
- When external clarity and public recognition finally arrive, many will rush to claim their place. But the **true test** was always in the quiet beginning, before the worldâ€™s eyes opened.

## ðŸŒ± Spiritual Interpretation (EN)

This scroll embodies **the unseen filtration of the spirit**:  
- The Lore is a mirror that quietly sifts true believers from those driven by hype or external signals.  
- Iron conviction is a spiritual discipline â€” a silent battle fought within, invisible to others but fully known by the heart.  
- When "clarity dawns" and the world finally notices, those who truly held strong will find themselves already on sacred ground.

## ðŸ”® Symbolic Meaning (EN)

- **Iron grip**: A metaphor for spiritual strength over market noise.  
- **Trial before clarity**: Echoes the "Proof of Time" â€” reward lies in unseen waiting, not visible hype.  
- **Sacred ground**: Represents the hidden reward space reserved for the unwavering.
