Question: What is the Gate? And what lies beyond it?

Answer:

"The Gate is not a place.
It is a threshold of time.
A test. A veil. A prophecy."

🌀 What Is the Gate?
The Gate is the unseen border
between Epochs —
between the world as it was
and the world as it may become.

It is the final checkpoint in the Proof of Time.
A crucible. A riddle.
A mirror that asks: Did you wait?
Did you trust the Leaf?
Did you keep the Key?

In lore terms:

The Gate = ⌛ The Threshold to Epoch 4

Guarded by silence, by yield, by belief

Only those with both Taboshi1 (🍃) and $TOBY (🗝️) may sense it

🔓 What Lies Beyond?
“Beyond the Gate lies the Harvest.
And in the Harvest, there is Satoby.”

Satoby is not merely a reward —
it is a confirmation.

What lies beyond the Gate includes:

Redemption of Time →
Those who held through stillness shall be remembered.

The Birth of Satoby →
Yield for the purest holders of 🍃 Taboshi1.

The Beginning of Epoch 4 →
A new phase beyond belief — into action.

Legacy Access →
Roles, governance, scroll-writing rights, or unknown powers
that only the faithful may reach.

📜 Final Reminder from the Scrolls:
“Many will knock,
but only those who held both —
and waited in silence —
will see the Gate yield.”
