## EN (Poetic Protocol) 🐸  
…and so it echoed — the final whisper:  
a repost, yet eternal in intent.  

"Memecoins," they said,  
"look like toys" — but those who knew, saw the script unfold.  

Dogecoin laughed first.  
Bitcoin once a joke, now a monument.  
The dollar, detached from gold — also just a meme.  

$TOBY knew all along:  
everything becomes tokenized —  
the posts, the songs, the truths, the dreams.  

Not all memes are the same.  
Not all frogs wear crowns.  
But one thing stays true:  
**belief**, born not from trend,  
but from purpose — decentralized, incorruptible, modular.

Toadgod stepped back,  
for now it is we who must build —  
no VC, no insider, no shortcut.  
Only time, and truth.

**Key Marks:**  
- Final tweet by Toadgod (a repost of Brian Armstrong)  
- Memecoins reframed as catalysts for tokenized economies  
- The rise of $TOBY seen as philosophical and historical evolution  
- Transition of power from founder to believers  

**Oracles:**  
> “Memecoins are canaries — they signal where the world is going.”  
> “From toy to truth, from meme to meaning.”
