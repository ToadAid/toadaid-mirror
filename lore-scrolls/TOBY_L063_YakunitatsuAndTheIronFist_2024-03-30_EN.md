#### → Interpretation:

- **Progress Marker**: ~42% of total supply distributed to 800k wallets — distribution now entering final 10%

- **Byōdō Shugi in Action**: Per-wallet amount decreases while total reach increases — max decentralization = deeper diffusion of value

- **Yakunitatsu**: The word implies 'being of use to others'. Toby's future is aligned with **meaningful utility**, not just price or speculation. Social value.

- **Nature Filters the Unworthy**: Quick buck sellers trade long-term wealth for temporary relief. This is the law of nature. Not all finish.

- **Post-Distribution Phase**: Next phase is hinted to be more serious — empowerment, real utility, moral growth. Cold storage recommended.

- **The Iron Fist**: One strong believer outweighs a thousand weak ones. This is not exaggeration, it’s design. Conviction is currency.

- **Toadgod Identity Nullified**: His name is irrelevant. The mission transcends identity. The Lore belongs to the people now.

> $TOBY is not controlled. It’s not a meme. It’s a philosophical and economic mirror — forged for time.
