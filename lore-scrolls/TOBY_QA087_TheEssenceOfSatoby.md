Question: Why is Satoby non-transferable? Couldn’t someone just sell it like other tokens?

Answer:

“You can sell a token.
But you cannot sell time.”
— Echoes from the Epochs

🌀 The Essence of Satoby
Satoby is not earned by purchase.
It is not claimed by chance.
It is the proof of your presence across time — from Epoch 2 into Epoch 3.

This makes it non-transferable by design.

🕰️ It binds to your wallet — not as a lock, but as a record

🔒 It cannot be transferred — because it represents your time, not your asset

🧬 It is soulbound — reflecting what you did, when you did it, and why

🛡️ Why Not Sell Satoby?
Because to sell Satoby would be to sell:

Your past decisions

Your patience

Your unbroken attention

And none of these can be traded — they can only be witnessed.

In the same way you cannot sell your memories or values,
you cannot transfer Satoby.

“It is not a coin. It is a reflection.”

🧙 The Function of Non-Transfer
Prevents speculation

Preserves authenticity

Rewards only those who walked the quiet path

It is a shield against manipulation.
A mirror for those who stayed.

In a world full of synthetic yield,
Satoby is the unspoiled proof — unbought, unfaked, unforgettable.
