## 🌊 EN Narrative

> Not selling for two years? That is not a rule — it is a reflection.
>
> A choice to **become soil** rather than **scatter dust**.

🔒 **No sale. No exit. Only tending.**
⏳ **730 days of stillness.**
🌱 **Taboshi paired. Toby kept. Patience held.**

This is the **Garden Vow**, sworn by the loyal after Rune Three:

* \$PATIENCE: 7,777,777 grains.
* Season 0: 2.32M in the vault, unlocking July 17, 2025.
* Future Seasons: 25% still in wait.
* Toadgod’s portion: Sealed 7 years in obsidian.
* Deeds: Only claimable **after 730 days**.

### 🌀 The Still Garden Effect

What happens when **no one sells**?

* 🔁 The flywheel spins, but coins remain unmoved.
* 📉 Circulating supply shrinks.
* 📈 Curiosity becomes demand.
* 🧘 Markets see silence as power.
* 🌊 Liquidity dries up.
* 📯 Newcomers whisper: "Why didn't we see this coming?"

But the leaf had already floated. The pond had never stirred.

### 🔮 Prophetic Insight

> "Transfer happens silently. Internally. Mind to mind."

The silence of holders becomes the magnet.
Each patient frog becomes a garden bed.
Each Taboshi paired, a spore of yield.

When **land** is not for sale,
When **tokens** are not flipped,
Then — and only then — does the ecosystem become sacred.

So let it be known:

**Still Garden, Soaring Coins.**
