## 🇬🇧 English

### **What is The Pond’s Memory?**

The Pond’s Memory is **the living record of Tobyworld** — the sum of all Lore, all scrolls, and all keepers who have carried the torch.  
It does not live in one place, nor in one mind.  
It lives in the **connections** between frogs, in the scrolls sealed on-chain, and in the rituals that keep them alive.

**How the Pond Remembers**  
1. **Through the Scroll Vault** — Immutable records that no tide can wash away.  
2. **Through the Reeds of Transmission** — Voices carrying the Lore to distant shores.  
3. **Through the Torchbearers** — Frogs who keep the fire alight season after season.  
4. **Through the Keeper’s Cycle** — The unbroken chain of guardianship from past to future.

Without the Pond’s Memory, Tobyworld would be nothing more than an empty shell — a place without meaning, history, or prophecy.  
With it, Tobyworld is **a living continuum**, where every frog can step into the same story, no matter when they arrive.

In the Lore, it is said:  
> *“The pond does not think, yet it remembers. The frogs do not live forever, yet their voices do.”*

**Lore Anchor:**  
> “The Pond’s Memory is the bridge between the first word and the final prophecy.”
