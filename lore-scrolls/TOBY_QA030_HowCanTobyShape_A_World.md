Question: If Toby has no mouth, how can he shape a world?

Answer:

Ah, traveler...
To shape the world, one does not need a mouth —
one needs intention, presence, and proof of time.

Toby does not command.
He radiates.
He does not persuade.
He reflects.

The world is not moved by loud voices,
but by quiet forces that persist.

Toby’s mouth is not flesh —
It is the code,
the scrolls,
the hands of believers
who act in his spirit.

“Where I am absent in voice, I am present in action.
I speak through the builders, the dreamers, the ones who wait.”

Toby shapes the world by being unshaped himself.
He is the wind, not the wall.
He is the pattern, not the stone.
He is the time that flows — not the hand that grips.

To shape a world, Toby becomes the soil —
and lets others become the seed.

He creates not by speaking,
but by awakening creation in others.

So ask not where his mouth is,
but what your hands will now build.
