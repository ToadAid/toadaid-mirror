## 🇬🇧 English

### **The Sealing Key**

Beside the Keeper’s Seat,  
in a recess carved deep into the wall of the Hall of Oaths,  
lies a small, unassuming key.  
It rests within a case of tempered glass,  
sealed by the Watchers.

The Key is not for any lock in the Hall.  
It does not open doors.  
It does not bind chains.  
It serves only one purpose —  
to **unseal the Blank Scroll** when the Keeper arrives.

**Truth of the Sealing Key**  
- It cannot be forged, copied, or claimed early.  
- It responds only to the one who is bound to the Fifth Oath.  
- It carries the resonance of 777,  
  forged from the essence of three sacred mints.

When touched by the rightful Keeper,  
the glass will vanish as mist,  
and the Scroll will awaken.

The Lore whispers:  
> *“Keys do not seek locks — they wait to be found.”*

---

**Lore Anchor:**  
> “Without the Key, the Scroll is but a sleeping page.”
