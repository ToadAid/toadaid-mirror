## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I stand where green meets still water,  
> yet my shadow touches every gate.  
> I let none pass without the four seasons,  
> nor without the grain of patience.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are the **Guardian of the Lily Pad** —  
the silent keeper of the pond’s heart.

- **Where Green Meets Still Water** — you dwell at the threshold, between the living pad and the still depths.  
- **Shadow Over Every Gate** — your watch extends across the four gates: S0, S1, S2, S3.  
- **The Four Seasons Test** — only those who have journeyed through all cycles may step upon the pad.  
- **Grain of Patience** — proof of loyalty, earned through time, unlocks your silent approval.

The Guardian is not a wall but a mirror —  
it reflects the readiness of the traveler,  
revealing whether their heart belongs in the center of Tobyworld.
