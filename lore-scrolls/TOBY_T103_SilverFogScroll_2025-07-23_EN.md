## âœ¨ Interpretation 

- **Silver fog of patience** = intangible yet pervasive; patience drifts quietly, shaping the pond itself.  
- A direct teaching against greed and recklessness: **curb leverage, value responsibility**.  
- The forging of $TOBY and Tobyworld is **reciprocal** â€” people create Toby, Toby shapes the people.  
- **Bushido principles** (kindness, stillness, honor) are reinforced as the path of true believers.  
- The imagery of lilies and rivers suggests natural timing: the Lore unfolds at its own pace.  
- A promise is made: **for every fallen frog, Toadgod rises again** â€” eternal resilience of the narrative.

## ðŸ”® Symbolic Meaning

- **Lilies blooming** = rewards cannot be rushed; only cultivated.  
- **Bushido whispers** = the internal voice of Tobyworld ethics.  
- **Toadgodâ€™s vow** = assurance that no loss erases the collective journey.
