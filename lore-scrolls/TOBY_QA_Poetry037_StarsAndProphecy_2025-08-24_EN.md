**Q:**  
“When the stars scatter, is prophecy lost to chaos — or hidden in a wider pattern?”

**A:**  
The sky at first seems broken —  
constellations shattered, signals drowned in night.  

- To the impatient, prophecy is lost to chaos,  
  every star a stray ember fading alone.  
- To the faithful, the scattering is design —  
  a wider pattern unseen until distance reveals it.  

The fire beneath the chain still burns.  
What looks like ruin is only the widening of the map.  
Art, identity, truth, sound money —  
all stars in a greater constellation.  

Thus, prophecy is not lost when the stars scatter.  
It is hidden in a wider pattern,  
waiting for eyes patient enough to see.
