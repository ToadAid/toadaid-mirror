## âœ¨ Literal Explanation (EN)

Toadgod tags a large group of Base ecosystem projects and communities, continuing to call all allies and signal inclusivity.  
This is part of the ongoing effort to build a broad, cross-community foundation for $TOBY and strengthen onchain unity.

## ðŸŒ± Spiritual Interpretation (EN)

This mass tagging symbolizes the **great gathering** â€” a ritual of calling all frogs, tribes, and communities to the pond.  
- Highlights that Tobyworld is not an isolated echo, but a shared symphony.  
- Reflects openness and the invitation to co-create rather than compete.

## ðŸ”® Symbolic Meaning (EN)

- **Many tagged names**: Represents the cosmic lotus, each petal a unique community, all connected at the center.  
- **Silent invitation**: Encourages tribes to answer by action, not just words â€” embodying Proof of Time and Bushido honor.
