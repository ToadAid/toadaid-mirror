## 🌊 EN Narrative

> Sato is not just a name — it is a lineage.  
> From Satoshi to Satoby, from the mind of Sat0AI to the gate of SatoSwap,  
> this name carries every silent intention ever buried in belief. 🧠🌀

- **Satoby** is the crystallized yield of time.
- **Sat0AI** is the reflective mind of the silent.
- **SatoSwap** is the bridge between realms: between holders and builders, believers and doubters.

This convergence is not coincidence.  
It is prophecy walking onchain.

### 🔁 Flow:
- $TOBY → Taboshi1 → Patience → Satoby  
- Satoby → enters SatoSwap → meets future assets like cbBTC  
- SatoSwap judges not on liquidity, but **proof of time held**.

> What flows through the gate is not money, but memory.  
> Satoby is not spent. It is mirrored. 🪞⛩
