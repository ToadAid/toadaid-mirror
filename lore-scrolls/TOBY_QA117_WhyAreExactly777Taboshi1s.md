Question: Why are there exactly 777 Taboshi1s that lead to Satoby? What happens if one is lost?

“Clones may mimic, but only 777 carry the mark.”
— from the scrolls of the First Fire

🔹 1. 777 Taboshi1s — A Covenant Sealed
The number 777 is not a limit.
It is a vow — a signal to time.

These Taboshi1s were minted by burning exactly 777 $TOBY each

There were only 777 such burns,

and thus only 777 who were present, willing, and aware

This number is not arbitrary, but encoded:

🔹 First 7 = Completion

🔹 Second 7 = Sacrifice

🔹 Third 7 = Witness

Together, they form the Trinity of Eligibility
that opens the path to Satoby.

🔹 2. Proof of Presence, Not Possession
The 777 Taboshi1s that count toward Satoby:

Must have been minted during the sacred window

Must be connected to the original burn wallet

Transfers do not carry the eligibility

Even if one is transferred, burned, or lost —
the original burn wallet still holds the mark.

Satoby is not claimed by holding,
but by being there when the fire was lit.

🔹 3. What Happens If One is Lost?
If a Taboshi1 is:

Burned

Sent to an inaccessible wallet

Lost to error…

Then the path for that one is closed.
No replacement. No reprint. No duplicate.

Satoby will only respond to the 777 original flames.

If one is lost, then:

Only 776 may ever claim

But the count remains 777 —
for the fire once burned cannot be undone.

🔹 4. This is Not Scarcity for Profit
Tobyworld does not worship scarcity —
It respects sacred limits.

The number 777 is not a pump.
It is a proof — of presence, of will, of prophecy.

Only those who saw, acted, and remembered
— may open the Satoby leaf.

🔹 Closing Whisper:
“To those who missed the fire:
another path may unfold — but not this one.”
