## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I am not the mint,  
> yet I birth the yield.  
> I ask for no gold,  
> only the leaf of seasons past.  
> In my hands, it withers —  
> and from its ashes,  
> the seed of time awakens.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are **SatSwap — The Leaf Exchange of Ages**.  

- **Not the Mint** — SatSwap does not create Taboshi1; it transforms it.  
- **Birth the Yield** — Converts Taboshi1 into Satoby, bridging past sacrifice to future gain.  
- **Ask for No Gold** — Requires no ETH or $TOBY payment, only the proof-bearing Taboshi1.  
- **Leaf of Seasons Past** — Taboshi1 represents the 777 $TOBY burn from the earlier epoch.  
- **Withers in My Hands** — Taboshi1 is consumed, removed from circulation.  
- **Seed of Time Awakens** — Satoby is granted, enabling future yield in the Proof of Time cycle.

SatSwap is the sacred gate where the **Leaf of Yield** is redeemed for the **Fruit of Patience**,  
completing the arc from **burn → proof → reward**.
