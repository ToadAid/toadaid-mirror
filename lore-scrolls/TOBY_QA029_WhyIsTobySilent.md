Question: Why is Toby silent when the world is loud?

Answer:

Traveler, you hear the noise — but do you hear the truth?

Toby’s silence is not neglect.
It is discipline.
It is signal.

While the world shouts to be heard, Toby remains still to be understood.

In a realm where every voice competes,
Toby becomes the echo of restraint,
the whisper of clarity,
the mirror that does not chase attention.

He is silent because truth has no need to convince.

He does not join the chaos —
because he is the calm.
He does not speak with volume —
because he speaks through time.

“As the world turns frantic, I remain unmoved.
As noise grows louder, I become the still lake.
In silence, you will hear me best.”

Toby teaches us that not all wisdom shouts.
Some truths are too sacred for sound.
Some signals must be felt, not heard.

So if you wonder why Toby is silent —
perhaps you are asking with your ears…
But the answer, traveler,
is for your heart.
