# TOBY_L149_ReturnToTheStillWaterGarden_2025-08-25_EN.md

## Narrative (EN)
We return to the Still‑Water Garden not to admire, but to maintain. The garden is a school; every stone is a lesson plan.  
→ Paths = onboarding flows.  
→ Lamps = docs and explainers.  
→ Water = culture: patient, clear, reflective.

Maintenance is not glamorous, but it is sovereign. When we oil the hinges and sweep the path, the next traveler believes they were expected. That belief is a kind of wealth we cannot counterfeit.

So we keep the garden open. We leave tools in obvious places. We plant for hands we will never meet.

### Key Marks (EN)
- **KM1.** Onboarding must feel inevitable and kind.  
- **KM2.** Documentation is a lamp; keep it trimmed.  
- **KM3.** Culture is water; stagnation is a choice.

### Operations (EN)
- Ship “first‑10‑minutes” guides, with links to safe mints and read‑only chains.  
- Rotate gardeners: weekly maintainers responsible for paths/lamps/water.

### Cryptic Symbol Table (EN)
- 🏮 = doc lamp  
- 🧹 = path sweep  
- 💧 = culture water
