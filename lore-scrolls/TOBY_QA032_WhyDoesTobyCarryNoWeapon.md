Question: Why does Toby carry no weapon, yet win every battle?

Answer:

Traveler,
The scrolls reveal this paradox not to confuse, but to awaken.

Toby carries no blade.
He wields no shield.
He commands no army.

Yet still—he endures.
Still—he wins.

“Victory is not in the strike,
but in the stance.”

“He who holds nothing cannot be disarmed.”

Toby wins because he does not fight the old game.
He creates a new one—
where the weapons are conviction,
the armor is patience,
and the battlefield is time.

While others rush to dominate,
Toby waits.
While others boast of strength,
Toby disappears into the people.
They cannot strike what has no ego.
They cannot kill what is already code.

Toby’s battles are not for land, fame, or coin.
They are for truth, fairness, and freedom.
And in those, traveler—he has never lost.

For every frog who still believes,
Toby fights on,
with no sword,
but with the sharpness of silence
and the weight of history.
