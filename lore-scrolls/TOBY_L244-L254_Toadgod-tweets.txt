# L244 – Uphill by Intention

# EN

Toadgod has endured many cycles — but this one feels different.  
A new wave of pessimism has emerged.  
Bearish emotion and skepticism spread quickly among newer participants.  
> Beware the poison.

Impatience blinds most in the short term.

---

# The Rigged Game

Zoom out. Look beyond just $TOBY.  
Government debt is exploding.  
Living standards are collapsing.  
And yet… the rich get richer?

A transfer is happening.  
In a rigged game.  
> Position well. Be patient.  
Toadgod cannot do it for you.

# The Importance of Soil

In recent weeks, decentralization proves itself again.  
True blue chips are planted in healthy soil.  
If the roots are spoiled,  
the tree will never grow.

Those who studied the Lore  
> See it all playing out in real-time.  
> By design.

---

# Community of Bushido

The $TOBY community holds the highest standard.  
Organic. Pure. Pristine mechanics.  
Each toad protects the prophecy.  
> For $TOBY is the people.  
You can't say this for most other tokens.

---

# Epoch 1 Reminder

- Launched at $TOBY's birth  
- Focus: equality & distribution  
- Over 30 days remain to hold sacred numbers  
- Taboshi is granted by conviction

Most won’t do it.  
But the toads who do — will win.  
> Reflexivity. Every Taboshi matters.

---

# Final Reminder

- The prophecy never changed.  
- Emotions do.  
- Fear does.  
- Short-term minds lie.

Everything worth having is uphill.  
The only way up — is with intention.  
> Not by accident.

# L245 – It is Written

# EN

When all is settled, $TOBY shall soar high.  
Imitators shall falter, and off they will die.  
Toad's believers, steadfast and wise,  
Will reap Taboshi’s yield — doubters pay the price.

777,777,777,777 + 777,777,777  
It is written.

---

This tweet affirms the prophecy’s climax:

- **$TOBY is designed for believers.**
- Those who hold will witness a sharp divide between the faithful and the opportunists.
- Taboshi's yield is not only spiritual but literal — a return written in numbers.
- The sacred 777 sequence seals the fate.

> $TOBY rises.  
> The imitators fall.  
> Taboshi yields.  
> The prophecy holds.

# L248 – Tobyworld: Step

toby world @base  
ステップ  
for the people: $toby

---

A new era. The visual marks it.

Toby sits atop the Earth — not to conquer, but to care.  
A meme, yet not just a meme.  
A movement, soft and strong.

---

What does it represent?

- $TOBY is global.  
- $TOBY is community.  
- $TOBY is peace.  
- $TOBY is the step beyond speculation.

The base layer of belief.  
The chain of conviction.

---

Why is it a step?

Because the journey is no longer just about airdrops.  
It is about **direction**.  
It is about **vision**.  
It is about the **people**.

A step forward.  
A step together.  
A step… into Tobyworld.

# L249 – The War Within

# EN

**Previous 2 weeks:** meditation and observation.  
Many weak hands folded. Some doubled down.  
Wealth and conviction transferred.  

Most do not have the patience or attention span to read this far —  
let alone hold $TOBY.

---

# The Reality of the Market

- War, ego, FUD, macro forces.
- Manipulated fiat, banks, and institutions.
- Imbalanced distributions and copycats.

Yet the Lore has long foreseen this.  
Patterns do not repeat, but they **rhyme**.

---

# The Speculative Truth

Is $TOBY just a meme?  
Is it pure speculation?

Yes — and so is every asset.  
Even Bitcoin. Even stocks.

Value forms from:

- Tech  
- Distribution  
- Adoption  
- Utility  
- Community  
- Speculative belief

> $TOBY is for the people.

---

# The Blueprint

No pre-sale.  
No KOLs.  
No insiders.  
No VCs.

> Toadgod refused to kiss the ring.

Designed with precision: chain, wallet, community, yield.  
Even sushi must be tasted by the people — or it means nothing.

---

# Epoch 1 Is Critical

- Designed for fair distribution  
- Every taboshi counts  
- The earlier, the better  
- The Lore already written

Those actively involved in Epoch 1 will benefit the most out of 3.  
Toadgod sees all: mod, guardian, builder, participant.  

---

# The Bigger Plan

$TOBY is not just a cute frog on @base.  
It is a structured system of yield and meaning.  
Fair drops were just the beginning.  

Those who sneer will fade.  
Those who endure the storm will rise.

---

# Final Words

Most chase too late.  
Most ignore wisdom when it’s free.  
The attention economy is the curse.

> But the war is within.  
> Those who win that war, will win everything.

**Taboshi. Satoby. Lore. All real.**  
Most won’t read this far — but if you did…

**Ishi no Ue ni mo San-nen**  
(Sit on a stone for three years — Persevere.)

# L250 – Fate Creates

# EN

everyone's memory is fleeting,  
but emotions ran high, just a week ago, we were down, scraping the sky.

as morale slowly reclaims,  
where else will the blue cute toad leap?  
the only way is upward, from the lowlands deep.

did anything change in last week's emotional dance?  
just fearful imaginations and unsure frail hands.

$toby grand plans stay unchanged,  
destiny awaits,  
only patience & time reveals what fate creates.

toby world @base — it’s coming.

# L251 – To Be Most Supreme

# EN

**Distribution & fundamentals: pristine.**

To protect the people. $TOBY is the people.  
Everything has been foretold within the Lore.  
No ill is wished on others — all is by design.  
Built to last — not for weeks, but for decades.

---

$TOBY has:

- No pre-sale  
- No KOLs  
- No VCs  
- No insiders  
- No hidden taxes  
- No corruption  
- No greed

---

All is fair — for the fallen frogs.  
Ignore the noise.  

Toad Lore will be discovered — slowly or fast.  
The prophecy will prevail.

---

There is no question.  
For everything was designed:  
> To be most supreme amongst all.

# L252 – Believe, and You May Qualify

# EN

**$TOBY is bigger than anyone imagines.**

But the question remains:  
**Did you believe?**

—> taboshi.io *(new qualifiers updating slowly)*

Toadgod holds no emotion.  
Sneerers. Doubters. Old toads. New toads.  
**All are welcome.**

For $TOBY was **built from nothing**, for the people —  
And for the people it will forever remain.

---

# The Journey

- Many transferred.  
- Many dropped off.  
- Many could not endure.  

But the **worthy path** was never meant to be easy.  
It is the troughs, not the peaks, that define $TOBY.

If you **lost your way** but find your light again —  
Toads welcome you back.  
It is not too late.  
You can still be eligible.

---

# The Lore and the Soil

Those who were here from the start  
witnessed how the **Lore was birthed**,  
from pure organic soil.

We rose valiantly —  
Through FUD,  
Through ridicule,  
Through silence.

And still — we grow.

---

# Numbers Don't Lie

- 777,777,777  
- 777,777,777,777  

**Taboshi is real. Satoby is real.**  
Do not miss the window.  
Hold strong.  
**Chances are not forever.**

---

# The 10% Principle

<10% study the Lore.  
<10% read the Tweets.

But that 10% will **reap** and **yield**  
Because $TOBY was **built to last**,  
**Built for equality**  
— a real wealth transfer.

---

# This Cycle Is Different

Memes will reign.  
But **not all**.

Only one is **built for the people**.  
Only one was **never compromised**.

> You can’t kill $TOBY.  
> Because $TOBY is not just a token.  
> It is belief. It is thought. It is us.

A frog. A toad. A symbol. A sign.  
A ray of hope. A community. A movement.  
A meme — and maybe… more.

There is only one.

**$TOBY World is coming. Believe.**

Do you qualify?

# L253 – Seeds of Glory

# EN

Over and over again the cycle remains:

**FUD → FOMO → COPE → Euphoria → Repeat.**  
A cancerous recipe for $TOBY.

---

But there is a cure:  
**Conviction.**  

Abandon the wall of worry.  
Let the mental stress melt away.  
The cycle only traps those who refuse to awaken.

---

Frail hands. Impatient profit takers.  
This is **normal** in a market designed to test.

> The price of short-term gains =  
> **True long-term wealth missed.**

Transfer happens silently.

---

We are on the brink of the print.  
Yet many still doubt,  
Even when it’s right in front of them.

**History rhymes.**  
But this time…  
> We go higher.  
> Beyond any other cycle.  
> Infinite summers ahead.

---

**Seeds of doubt or seeds of glory — your choice.**

Everything is by design.

**Believe.**

# L254 – Taboshi's Grand Array

# EN
It’s tough to see, but you must go  
in mind and heart before you show.  
That’s why discomfort’s hard to bear,  
for those who aren't yet fully there.  

---

A great run’s unfolding, it’s true,  
with signs all pointing “up” for you.  
Presidents and governments print,  
fiat currencies start to stint.  

---

Risk assets and institutions join,  
to form a behemoth, well coined.  
Toadgod planned it all way ahead,  
intra-day is noise, think long instead.  

---

Months and years, $TOBY will stay,  
let worry go, and imagination blaze.  
Cabals’ musical chairs may come & then depart,  
but 777,777 and Epoch 1 won’t ever restart.  

---

So long live Taboshi’s grand array,  
in this world, it’s here to stay.  

---


# INTERPRETATION - L254

This poem reinforces $TOBY's long-term vision, reminding readers that short-term confusion or discomfort is normal. It emphasizes macro patterns (e.g., governments printing money), institutional involvement, and the foresight of toadgod.  

Key references:
- **“intra-day is noise”**: A message for traders to zoom out.
- **“Epoch 1 won’t restart”**: Reinforces the sacred, one-time opportunity tied to Taboshi and the 777 numbers.
- **“Taboshi’s grand array”**: Poetic confirmation of the design's sacred structure.

Takeaway: Those who endure with imagination, patience, and belief will be the ones who benefit most from this once-in-history phase.
