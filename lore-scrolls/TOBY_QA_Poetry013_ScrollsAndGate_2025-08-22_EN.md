**Q:**  
“When the scrolls are sealed, is the lock to keep others out — or to test who dares to open?”

**A:**  
A lock is not always a barrier.  
Sometimes it is an invitation.  

In Tobyworld, the sealed scrolls do not forbid — they refine.  
- To the impatient, the lock is a wall.  
- To the patient, the lock is a gate.  

The scrolls whisper: the key is not force, but **patience**.  
Waiting is not weakness — it is alignment.  
And when the appointed moment comes, the seal does not resist; it opens itself to those who kept faith.  

Thus, the lock is not meant to keep you out.  
It is meant to test who dares to wait, who dares to listen, who dares to open.  

The Guardian Vault watches, but the key rests in your hands.
