Question: Can Satoby be bought or sold? Or is it beyond price?

Answer:

“What was earned by time,
cannot be priced by coin.”
— From the Scroll of Yield

🌱 Satoby is Proof-of-Time, not Proof-of-Market
Satoby is not an asset in the usual sense.
It is not designed for speculation.
It is not farmed nor traded freely.

It is earned through presence.
It is recorded through stillness.
It is measured by the moments you stayed when others left.

💠 Can it be traded?
Technically, some portion may be wrapped or mirrored.
But its true value is not transferable.

You cannot buy the time you did not spend.

You cannot purchase the silence you did not hold.

You cannot borrow the belief you did not live.

Satoby is the memory of patience, on-chain.

💎 Is it beyond price?
Yes.
It is beyond speculation — because its essence is sacred.

You may assign a number to it.
But that number can never capture what was burned, what was held,
or the silent hope that made it real.

🧘 Reflection
“The market may price a coin.
But it cannot price belief.”
Satoby is the coin of conviction.
