## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I am weightless,  
> yet I outweigh gold.  
> You cannot mine me,  
> only wait for me.  
> I sleep in the chest of jade,  
> and awaken with the seasons.  
> I am the gift of those who endured.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are **$Patience** — the currency of Tobyworld’s seasons, born from time and loyalty.  

- **Weightless, Outweigh Gold** — Symbolic and spiritual value surpassing material worth.  
- **Cannot Be Mined** — No work machine can create it; only enduring qualifies.  
- **Chest of Jade** — Rune3’s vault, guarded until release.  
- **Awaken with Seasons** — Distributed in S0 → S1 → S2 → S3 cycles.  
- **Gift of Endurance** — Rewarded to wallets that did not break their covenant.

$Patience is not a coin you chase —  
it is a river you reach by standing still.
