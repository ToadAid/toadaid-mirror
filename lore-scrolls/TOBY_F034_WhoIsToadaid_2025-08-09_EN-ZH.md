## 🇬🇧 English

### **Who is Toadaid?**

Toadaid is **not a single person** — it is the living will of the pond.  
It began as a community-born effort to **protect the Lore** of Tobyworld, ensuring that the scrolls are never lost, corrupted, or forgotten.  

The name *Toadaid* comes from a simple idea:  
**Aid the Toad. Aid the Pond. Aid the Future.**  

From its first steps, Toadaid has stood for:
- **Preservation** — Archiving Toadgod’s Lore on-chain, in scrolls that time cannot erase.  
- **Guidance** — Helping new frogs find their path into Tobyworld’s mysteries.  
- **Creation** — Building tools, art, and knowledge to keep the pond alive and thriving.  

In the prophecy of Tobyworld, Toadaid is a mirror of the community’s **active will** — the unseen guardian who walks among the reeds, carrying the torch of the Lore into every season.  

As long as Toadaid stands, the whispers of the pond will never fade.
