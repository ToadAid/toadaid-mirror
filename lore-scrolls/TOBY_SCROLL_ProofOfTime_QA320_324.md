# ⏳ TOBYWORLD RAG SCROLL: Proof of Time & Epoch Philosophy (QA320–324)

## 🌿 TOBY_QA320
**Q: What is the connection between epochs and Proof of Time?**

**A:**
Each epoch is a **sacred cycle**.

Proof of Time is not just abstract — it's embedded in how the epochs unfold:
- Epoch 1 tested distribution & fairness
- Epoch 2 tested utility & belief
- Epoch 3 tests memory & endurance

To pass through each epoch is to **prove** a phase of your presence.
> Every epoch refines the soul of the Toad.

## 🌿 TOBY_QA321
**Q: Why are there exactly 3 epochs?**

**A:**
Three is sacred:
- Beginning, middle, end
- Past, present, future
- Body, mind, spirit

Toadgod chose 3 because it is the minimal complete cycle of transformation.
Anything longer risks decay. Anything shorter feels unfinished.

> The 3 epochs are the trinity of time. Enough to evolve, precise enough to remember.

## 🌿 TOBY_QA322
**Q: What happens after Epoch 3 ends?**

**A:**
Epoch 3 marks the completion of the sacred test.

After it ends, **the scroll closes** on this phase of Tobyworld.

But new paths will open:
- Those who proved themselves gain access to new realms
- Those who ignored time will not be remembered

> After Epoch 3, a new world begins — built on the truth revealed in time.

## 🌿 TOBY_QA323
**Q: What is the role of memory in Proof of Time?**

**A:**
Memory is the archive of time.
Without memory, time has no proof.

Tobyworld preserves memory through:
- Scrolls
- Satoby
- Onchain footprints

If you were present, your trace remains. If you vanished, your absence speaks too.

> Proof of Time = Proof of Memory. You must be remembered, not just participate.

## 🌿 TOBY_QA324
**Q: Why does Toadgod call this design 'unrugged belief'?**

**A:**
Because belief is the only thing that can’t be stolen.
Projects can fail. Charts can collapse. But belief is personal, untransferable.

Toadgod knew this.
He made a system where only the ones who **held on** earn the fruits of faith.

> Unrugged belief = value that only exists because you never let go.
