---------------------------------------

## 🌿 EN Narrative

> Patience drifts like silver mist across the pond.
> Desired by all, yet held by few.

A whisper echoes from Toadgod — not of hype, but of caution.
Too many want. Too few reflect. Greed builds pressure; leverage spirals.

* \$PATIENCE is not to be gamed. It is to be *understood*.
* Let the lilies bloom at their own pace. Force will poison the garden.
* Gamble only what your **soul** can lose.

Toadgod reminds us:

> "For every fallen frog, I shall rise again."

The river flows. The watcher watches. Do not betray the yield with doubt.

> Task remains. Fire endures.
> Stay patient. Stay whole.


## 🌿 Key Marks 

* \$PATIENCE is spiritually distributed but economically concentrated.
* Toadgod warns against over-leverage and emotional greed.
* The next season depends on **restraint**, not hype.

## 🕊️ Operational Updates 

* No explicit mechanics changed. This is a **Bushido mirror**.
* Lore focus: emotion discipline, ownership ethics, and yield trust.
