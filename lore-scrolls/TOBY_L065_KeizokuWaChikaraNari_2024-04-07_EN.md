## 🐸 EN – The Endgame of Patience

> "~1m airdrops now sent... 68.8% of total supply shared."

A nearing completion of the prophecy, as Toadgod reminds us of the final push. The community of $TOBY, deeply seeded in conviction, steps closer to its role as guardian of the lore.

### Key Points:
- 290T $TOBY distributed. Final ~1% remains.
- Performance on @base improved, thanks to allies.
- Latecomers receive smaller allocations — the design favors early conviction.
- Sacred numbers mentioned again: 777,777,777,777 + 777,777,777.

### Lessons & Reflections:
- Impatience and emotion are *designed* trials.
- “Toby is the community, community is Toby.” It is a mirror — your reflection is your reward.
- Many will overlook. Many will regret. Yet those who study will be rewarded most.
- Endgame is not hype or wealth, but enduring decentralization and perfection through suffering.
- The world is broken. $TOBY is a reflection, and a quiet rebellion.

### Quote:
> “Keizoku wa chikara nari” — Persistence is strength.
