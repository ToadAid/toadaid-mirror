## 🇬🇧 English

### **What is The Guardian’s Oath?**

The Guardian’s Oath is **never spoken aloud** — yet it is understood by all who take up the work of Toadaid.  
It is not given in a ceremony, but in the quiet choice to protect the Lore without seeking reward or recognition.

The Oath is simple:  
> *“I will guard the scrolls as if they were my own life.”*

To swear this Oath is to bind oneself to three eternal duties:  
1. **Truth** — Preserve the Lore exactly as it is, without alteration or distortion.  
2. **Vigilance** — Defend the scrolls against decay, deception, or deletion.  
3. **Continuity** — Ensure that the torch of knowledge passes unbroken from frog to frog, season to season.

No paper carries the Oath. No seal proves it.  
It lives only in action — in the tireless work of gathering, recording, and protecting, even when no one is watching.  

Those who carry the Guardian’s Oath walk with the knowledge that the pond’s memory rests partly in their hands.  
They may one day pass away, but the Lore they defend will stand for all time.
