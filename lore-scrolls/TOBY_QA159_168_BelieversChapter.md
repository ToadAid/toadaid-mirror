**Q: What does it mean to truly believe in $TOBY?**

**Q: Why is silence such a big part of this?**

**A:**
Because noise fades. Lore remains.

In Tobyworld, silence is not absence â€” it is cultivation.
We grow not by shouting, but by listening.

> In silence, the patient hear the whispers.
> In silence, the truth becomes clear.

**Q: Is holding Taboshi1 really that important?**

**A:**
Yes. It is the original leaf.

Minted by fire, burned from 777 $TOBY, it is proof of sacrifice.
It is the first covenant between Toad and Time.

> To hold Taboshi1 is to say:
> 'I was there when it began. I believed before it was safe.'

**Q: How is time a form of proof in Tobyworld?**

**A:**
Because anyone can buy.
But few can wait.

Time reveals the true holders.
Time proves who endures without needing applause.

> This is the Proof of Time.
> Quiet. Undeniable. Eternal.

**Q: What if others donâ€™t understand what Iâ€™m holding?**

**A:**
Then hold even tighter.

You are not here to explain.
You are here to embody.

> Let your patience be louder than their doubt.
> The Lore will reveal itself in time.

**Q: Why is $TOBY called a mirror?**

**A:**
$TOBY reflects you.
It does not promise. It reveals.

If you seek hype, youâ€™ll find silence.
If you seek truth, youâ€™ll find yourself.

> A mirror gives nothing â€” but shows everything.
> That is what $TOBY is.

**Q: What is the reward for patience?**

**A:**
The reward is not only what you receive â€” but who you become.

You become grounded.
You become aware.
You become unshakeable.

> And when the time comes, those who waited will harvest more than yield.
> They will harvest understanding.

**Q: Why does Toadgod speak in riddles?**

**A:**
Because truth isnâ€™t handed. Itâ€™s uncovered.

Riddles are protection â€” only the ready will see.
And the act of deciphering makes you worthy of the truth.

> Riddles are seeds. Those who water them with attentionâ€¦ bloom.

**Q: What is the sacredness of the number 777?**

**A:**
777 is the covenant.
It is the number of belief, of early sacrifice, of cosmic balance.

In Tobyworld, 777 is more than digits â€” it is destiny.

> Every Taboshi1 was born from 777 $TOBY.
> Every Satoby remembers that number.
> That is why it is sacred.

## ðŸŒ¿ TOBY_QA168
**Q: How do I carry the Lore to others?**

**A:**
Not by shouting.
Not by forcing.

But by living it.
By embodying the silence, the patience, the fire.

> Those who carry Lore, carry light.
> And light does not argue. It illuminates.
