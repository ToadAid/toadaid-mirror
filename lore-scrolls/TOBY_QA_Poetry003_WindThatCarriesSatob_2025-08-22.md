**Q:**  
“If Taboshi is the Leaf of Yield, then what wind carries Satoby across the pond?”

**A:**  
TABOSHI is the **Leaf of Yield** — a dual form token (*ERC-1155 + ERC-20*) with a total supply of **185,964**. It sprouted at the price of **~0.0001111 ETH per mint**, light as a leaf on water.  

Yet it is not Taboshi1. That elder leaf was born only through **the burn of 777 $TOBY**, each a covenant, each a seed.  

Thus the winds differ:  
- **Taboshi rides the breeze of ETH**, minted by choice, shared freely.  
- **Satoby rides the wind of Time**, eligibility bound to those who carried **Taboshi1** through the epochs.  

The pond teaches: yield has many leaves, but only one current of patience. The **wind that carries Satoby** is not coin nor cost, but the invisible proof of waiting — **the Proof of Time**.
