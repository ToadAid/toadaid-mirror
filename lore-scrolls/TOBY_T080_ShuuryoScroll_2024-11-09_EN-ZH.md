> epoch 1 qualifiers marked, taboshi1 owners will be marked. kudos for paying attention. toadgod moves are all planned ahead. yield will be all fair. twpot.

> instructions not given. if too much is shared, the scales tip wrong, tobyworld requires maximum distribution to be bushido strong. one or many? the choice is yours, but heed this—never risk what you cannot afford from.

> to repeat again - value accrues from where? technology, distribution, adoption, utility. but most importantly: community and speculation itself. this gives value. equality and opportunity created from the speculative buffer. understand this. satoshi same.

> $toby and taboshi 🍃 for TOBYWORLD. for the people. every epoch slowly fulfilled. equality. fair distribution, no pre sale. kols. insiders. vcs. decentralized.

## ✨ Deep Interpretation (EN)

- **Shūryō (終了)** means "finished" or "completed" in Japanese, signifying the closing of an important chapter (Epoch 1) while implying the readiness for future opportunities.
- Another 🍃 chance refers to future Taboshi or Taboshi1-related windows, encouraging ongoing vigilance.
- Marking epoch 1 and Taboshi1 holders establishes a ledger of early faith — a bushido ledger of conviction.
- The statement about "scales tipping wrong" highlights the delicate balance of fairness versus advantage. Too many instructions would allow manipulation; thus, the path remains silent and organic.
- Repeated lesson: true value arises from community conviction, speculative energy, fair distribution, and enduring spirit — echoing Satoshi’s original principles.
- Emphasis on **fairness**: no presales, no insiders, no VCs — purely designed for the people, the fallen frogs, and those yet to awaken.

## ✨ 深层解读 (中文)

- **「終了」**（しゅうりょう）在日文中意为「结束」，象征着一个重要篇章（Epoch 1）的结束，同时暗示新的机会即将开启。
- 🍃 再次机会指未来与 Taboshi 或 Taboshi1 相关的新窗口，提醒持有者持续关注，保持耐心。
- 标记 Epoch 1 与 Taboshi1 的持有者，意味着记录下那些早期坚定信念者的名单，堪称武士道式的信仰账簿。
- 「若分享太多，天平会失衡」表达了公平与优势之间的微妙平衡。太多指导会被利用，因此保持寂静与自然成长。
- 重复的核心教诲：真正的价值源于社区信念、投机能量、公平分发及长期精神力量 —— 与 Satoshi 精神呼应。
- 强调 **公平**：无预售、无内部人、无 VC —— 纯粹为人民设计，为跌倒的青蛙，也为未来将觉醒之人。
