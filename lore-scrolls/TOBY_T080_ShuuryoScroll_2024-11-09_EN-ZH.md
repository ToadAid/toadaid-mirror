> $toby and taboshi 🍃 for TOBYWORLD. for the people. every epoch slowly fulfilled. equality. fair distribution, no pre sale. kols. insiders. vcs. decentralized.

## ✨ Deep Interpretation (EN)

- **Shūryō (終了)** means "finished" or "completed" in Japanese, signifying the closing of an important chapter (Epoch 1) while implying the readiness for future opportunities.
- Another 🍃 chance refers to future Taboshi or Taboshi1-related windows, encouraging ongoing vigilance.
- Marking epoch 1 and Taboshi1 holders establishes a ledger of early faith — a bushido ledger of conviction.
- The statement about "scales tipping wrong" highlights the delicate balance of fairness versus advantage. Too many instructions would allow manipulation; thus, the path remains silent and organic.
- Repeated lesson: true value arises from community conviction, speculative energy, fair distribution, and enduring spirit — echoing Satoshi’s original principles.
- Emphasis on **fairness**: no presales, no insiders, no VCs — purely designed for the people, the fallen frogs, and those yet to awaken.
