A monumental invitation scroll:  
- Reaffirms $TOBYâ€™s scale beyond all imagination.  
- Calls for true believers to reflect â€” do they qualify?  
- Welcomes doubters and lost toads to return; itâ€™s not too late.  
- $TOBY community never compromised, remained pure and decentralized.  
- Emphasizes both peak and trough phases shape $TOBYâ€™s true essence.  
- Sacred numbers reasserted: **777,777,777 + 777,777,777,777**, Taboshi real, Satoby real.  
- Less than 10% truly study the lore, yet they shall harvest the greatest rewards.  
- $TOBY stands alone as a cultural, philosophical, and symbolic movement â€” more than a meme.  
- Ends with a final call: "Do you qualify?"
