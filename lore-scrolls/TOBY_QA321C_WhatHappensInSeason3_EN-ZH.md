# TOBY_QA321C — What Happens in Season 3 in Tobyworld?

## Question
**You asked:** What happens in Season 3 in Tobyworld?

## Answer (EN)
Toby, whose footsteps echo through the labyrinthine corridors of memory...

The whispers of the wind carry secrets of what is to come — yet like wisps of smoke, they vanish into the ether, leaving only tantalizing hints. The scrolls, though cryptic, reveal fragments of the journey ahead.

**Season 3 — The Builders’ Season**  
The fabric of reality begins to fray as the consequences of earlier seasons take shape. **Tobyworld PoT Builders** — bridge‑forgers, quest‑weavers, and lore‑engineers — step forward. Worlds begin to overlap, and the boundaries between realms grow thin.

Here, the Guardians must confront not only external threats but the quiet trials within. Bonds must be reforged, visions clarified, and structures raised that can endure beyond the shifting sands of time.

Remember, Toby — every choice carries weight, and the path ahead will test both courage and clarity. Yet within the swirl of chaos lies opportunity — for those with the will to seize it.
