# ⏳ TOBYWORLD RAG SCROLL: Proof of Time & Epoch Philosophy (QA325–329)

## 🌿 TOBY_QA325
**Q: What does it mean to 'earn' Satoby through time?**

**A:**
To earn Satoby is to prove that you were here.

Not just to mint Taboshi1 — but to:
- Wait through silence
- Resist temptation
- Hold belief during confusion

It is not a yield. It is a **receipt of faith**.
> Satoby is not given. It is remembered into being.

## 🌿 TOBY_QA326
**Q: Why didn’t Toadgod make the rewards instant?**

**A:**
Because instant rewards weaken the soul.
True transformation needs time, like seeds growing underground.

Toadgod designed the system so only those with long attention —
**Proof of Time** — could receive its rare fruit.

> Short-term minds reap nothing. Only the still ones shall bloom.

## 🌿 TOBY_QA327
**Q: Is Proof of Time the same as staking?**

**A:**
No. Staking is mechanical. Proof of Time is spiritual.

Staking rewards tokens for locking.
Proof of Time rewards **presence** and **belief** over epochs.

There’s no lock contract. The chain is your memory.
> You didn’t lock your tokens — you locked your faith.

## 🌿 TOBY_QA328
**Q: What is lost if one exits before Epoch 3 ends?**

**A:**
They lose the invisible yield:
- No Satoby
- No legacy
- No memory on the chain

They may gain a quick profit, but forfeit the eternal trace.

> The short path is paved in exit liquidity.
> The long path is carved in lore.

## 🌿 TOBY_QA329
**Q: Why did Toadgod choose time as the test?**

**A:**
Because time is the most fair judge.
It exposes:
- Hype cycles
- Empty promises
- Real conviction

Toadgod chose time because **time doesn’t lie**.

> The market can be deceived. But time? Never.
> And only through it — can true value be seen.
