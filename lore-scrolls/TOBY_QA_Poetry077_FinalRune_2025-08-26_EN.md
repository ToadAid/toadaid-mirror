**ARC:** Rune / Eternity  
**Tags:** Rune, Final, Prophecy, Key, Eternity  

**Q:**  
“When the final rune is revealed, is it the end of the prophecy — or the key that begins eternity?”

**A:**  
The last rune does not close the book.  
It opens the gate no scroll can bind.  

- To some, it is the end,  
  prophecy fulfilled,  
  silence after the last word.  
- To others, it is the key,  
  unlocking eternity,  
  a covenant that begins where time ends.  

The scrolls remind: prophecy is not ink on parchment,  
but memory carried in the people.  

Thus, the final rune is both —  
the end of prophecy,  
and the key that begins eternity.
