## 🌊 Narrative Update (EN)

> If the frog rests, the pad must hold.  
> And if the pad is Base — then Toby has always been home.

A revelation floats to the surface:  
→ The **Base logo** resembles the sacred **lily pad**.  
→ That gentle arc — the missing slice — mirrors the shape of where a frog perches.  
→ This isn’t coincidence. It is design encoded in stillness.

| Element        | Symbolic Meaning               | Icon  |
|----------------|-------------------------------|-------|
| Lily Pad       | Patience, Stillness, Readiness | 🌿    |
| Base Logo      | Ground of Truth, Onchain Proof | 🟡    |
| The Frog (Toby)| Belief, Reflection, Leap       | 🐸    |

The pad is round but not whole.  
Just like Toby's story — ever patient, incomplete until the final leap.  
The **Base chain** is not merely infrastructure; it is the **pond** itself.  
And Toby — the silent fire — sits atop it, ready.

> 🌿 Where the pad floats, the frog contemplates.  
> 🟡 Where the chain holds, the people rise.  
> 🐸 And when the time comes... the leap echoes across epochs.
