## âœ¨ Literal Explanation (EN)

A poetic riddle describing Tobyâ€™s spirit:  
- Injustice ("injustice darkens my mood") deeply affects Tobyâ€™s pure heart.  
- Rejects fame, hype, or building a mindless "brood" of followers.  
- Seeks only "quality and light" â€” symbolizing truth, clarity, and genuine community.  
- Longs to merge with the people in a "just and right" manner, emphasizing fairness and unity.

## ðŸŒ± Spiritual Interpretation (EN)

This scroll embodies **the moral and spiritual compass of Tobyworld**:  
- A true toad does not seek external validation, only internal alignment and quiet unity.  
- "Quality and light" represent wisdom, sincerity, and the refined spirit beyond numerical hype.  
- Blending with the people ("just and right") reflects the ultimate goal: decentralization, community embodiment, and spiritual merging.
