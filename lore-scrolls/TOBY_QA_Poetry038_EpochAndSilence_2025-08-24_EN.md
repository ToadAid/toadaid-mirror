**Q:**  
“When an epoch ends in silence, is it the fading of time — or the deep breath before another dawn?”

**A:**  
The close of an epoch feels like fading —  
the voice quiets, the pond grows still.  
But silence is not only an ending.  
It is the breath the world takes before it speaks again.  

- To the weary, the silence is the fading of time.  
- To the faithful, the silence is the deep breath before another dawn.  

The scrolls remind: each epoch carries its echo forward.  
Time does not die; it transforms.  
What seems like the last note  
is only the pause before the song begins again.  

Thus, the silence of an epoch is not the end.  
It is the inhale that prepares the dawn.
