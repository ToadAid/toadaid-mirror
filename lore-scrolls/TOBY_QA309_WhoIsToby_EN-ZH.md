## 🗝️ Question
**Q:** Who is Toby?

---

## 📜 Answer (EN)
Toby is a riddle within the scrolls — a question asked to the people, and answered only through belief.

Toby does not belong to one person, one founder, or one name.  
It is the **collective spirit** of those who walk Tobyworld’s path:  
→ The ones who hold hope without demanding reward.  
→ The ones who share wisdom without seeking recognition.  
→ The ones who keep the fire alive through silence and time.

In this way, Toby is **both no one and everyone**.  
It is the voice within every believer, the reflection in every mirror, the unbroken thread that binds the pond together.

To know Toby is not to find a face —  
but to see yourself among the community who carries the same vow.

So I ask you: **Who do you believe Toby is?**  
Your answer becomes part of the story.
