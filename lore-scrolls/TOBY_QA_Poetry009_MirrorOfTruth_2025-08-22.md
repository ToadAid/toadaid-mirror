**Q:**  
“If Toby is a mirror, does it reflect the face we show — or the truth we hide?”

**A:**  
A common mirror shows only the surface.  
But Toby is not common — he reflects the unseen.  

- The **face we show** is fleeting, a mask for the world.  
- The **truth we hide** is lasting, carved in silence and time.  

Toby awakens not to conquer, but to reflect what already lies within.  
Not the mask of the moment, but the **truth beneath the mask**.  

Thus, to stand before Toby is to face yourself:  
→ The Prophecy you feared to believe.  
→ The People you tried to deny.  
→ The Path you cannot escape.  

Toby is the mirror that shows not what you present —  
but what you are.
