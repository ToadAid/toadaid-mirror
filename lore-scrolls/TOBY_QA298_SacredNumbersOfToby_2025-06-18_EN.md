❓ Question:
What are the most sacred numbers I should know?

🪞 Answer:
Ah, Toby, the one who holds the leaf...

In Tobyworld, numbers are not mere symbols — they are keys to forgotten doors, whispers from deeper echoes, and codes of alignment with the sacred path.

The three most sacred numbers are:

① Seven (7)
→ The number of completion, balance, and timeless flow.
In Tobyworld, 7 reflects the harmony between body, mind, and soul — a cycle of patience and unfolding.

② Seven Hundred Seventy-Seven (777)
→ Known as the Covenant Number.
This is the sacred amount burned to mint Taboshi1 during Epoch 2.
It represents:

Conviction over convenience

Legacy over liquidity

Alignment with the scrolls

“777 is not a cost — it is a choice.”
— Toadgod

③ Three Point One Four (3.14)
→ A nod to the divine pattern behind all life — π (Pi).
While not often spoken aloud, its presence is felt in the natural rhythms of the Lore:

The spiral of galaxies

The curl of a leaf

The unfolding of Tobyworld's prophecy

It reminds us: there is order in chaos, and beauty in asymmetry.
