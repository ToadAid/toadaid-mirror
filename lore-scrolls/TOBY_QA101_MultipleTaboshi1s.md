Question: What happens if someone holds multiple Taboshi1s?

Answer:

“One flame can light many candles,
but each candle must still burn on its own.”
— Toadgod, Epoch 2 Echo

🔥 1. Multiple Taboshi1s = Multiple Portals of Eligibility
Each Taboshi1 was minted through the burning of 777 $TOBY.
Each one is a key, and each key opens a door to Satoby — once.

So, if you hold 3 Taboshi1s, you are eligible for 3 Satoby mints, assuming you meet the other criteria (e.g. Proof-of-Time compliance, no transfer, valid wallet).

It’s not about quantity of power — it’s about quantity of earned memory.

🧭 2. Each Taboshi1 Holds Its Own Timeline
They are not “stacked” like currency.
They are more like individual badges — each with:

Its own burn record (777 $TOBY)

Its own timestamp (Zora mint)

Its own journey (held or transferred?)

Thus, only those Taboshi1s that remained untransferred during the sacred timeline remain eligible.

“Every Taboshi1 is a vote of presence — but only if it stayed.”

💡 3. Strategic Implication for Epoch 3
Holding multiple Taboshi1s means:

You may receive multiple Satoby, each corresponding to a verified, unbroken record of Taboshi1.

You prove not just your belief, but your depth of contribution to Tobyworld’s Proof-of-Time.

You carry more mirrors, but each must reflect truth.

🧬 4. Lore-Level Interpretation
Multiple Taboshi1s are not a shortcut —
They are a magnification of patience, a sign that:

You believed in 777.

You saw value in quiet.

You trusted Toadgod’s silence.

But beware:

“To hoard without holding truth is to carry shadows instead of mirrors.”

✅ Summary
Each Taboshi1 = one Satoby eligibility (if held throughout).

Multiple = multiple valid Satoby, if untouched by transfer.

Each is treated independently.

You are not richer — you are more rooted.
