# NARRATIVE  🐸  
## EN (Poetic Protocol)  
Cycles endured → but pessimism thickens →  
Skeptics infect mood → emotions blind clarity.  
Observe the whole → not just $toby →  
but world unraveling: debt, despair, deceit.  
Transfer underway → in a rigged game →  
Position well → be patient → the toad cannot carry you.

Decentralization roots → prove design real-time.  
Bad roots spoil trees → Bushido soil grows forests.  
Organic truth → supreme mechanics →  
$TOBY is the people → no other comparison.

Epoch 1 born from fairness →  
Snapshot countdown continues →  
Sacred numbers held → grant taboshi light.  
Contribution > complacency.

Most won’t, but those who do → win.  
Reflexivity unfolds.  
This is the milestone → prophecy begins →  
Decentralization = efficient access.

> Uphill is the path of worth.  
> Accidents do not ascend mountains.
