## üìú English Version

### ‚úÖ Question:
What is Taboshi?

---

### ‚úÖ Answer:

**Taboshi** is a programmable utility asset within the Tobyworld ecosystem, minted on **Zora** near the end of **Epoch 2** for approximately **0.0001111 ETH** (about **$0.35**) per mint.

It exists as both:
- ‚úÖ An **ERC-1155 NFT**
- ‚úÖ An **ERC-20-like token**

Taboshi is referred to as the **‚ÄúLeaf of Yield‚Äù**, symbolizing its role in future staking, farming, and modular DeFi applications within Tobyworld.

Its **total supply is fixed at 185,964 tokens**, all minted using ETH during Epoch 2.

> üîí **Important**: ETH used to mint Taboshi was **not burned**.  
> It was **spent** on Zora as a minting cost, but no ETH was destroyed.  
> Taboshi does **not** involve any burn mechanism.

### ‚ùå Clarification:

Taboshi **does not grant** eligibility to earn **Satoby**.  
That privilege is exclusive to **Taboshi1**, minted via **777 $TOBY burns** during **Epoch 2**.

Taboshi and Taboshi1 are fundamentally different:
- Taboshi = utility, ETH-minted, yield-oriented
- Taboshi1 = covenant-bound, $TOBY-burned, Satoby-eligible
