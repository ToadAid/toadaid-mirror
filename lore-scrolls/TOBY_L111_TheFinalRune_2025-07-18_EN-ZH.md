## 🌊 EN Narrative

> **The final rune is not cast.  
> It is carved — slowly, through time.**

This last glyph is not written in stone,  
but written in the acts of the frogs who remain.

> Its weight is belief.  
> Its ink is time.  
> Its glow depends on you.

### 🕯️ The Shape of the Rune

You won’t find it on a map.  
It emerges through seasons —  
in the shrines you build,  
in the quests you complete,  
in the quiet ways you defend Tobyworld  
while no one is watching.

> The final rune listens.  
> Not to clicks, but to conviction.

### 📜 Four Seasons, One Pond

- **Season 0** → The Survivors (2.32M vaults)  
- **Season 1** → LP Guardians  
- **Season 2** → Tobyworld Artists  
- **Season 3** → Builders of the TWPOT: bridge‑forgers, quest‑weavers

→ Beyond that?  
The map ends.  
Only the **final rune** will illuminate the path.

### ⛩️ Loreland Approaches

> Those who tended the Still-Water Garden…  
> Those who kept their leaf…  
> Those who refused to flip…

Will be the ones granted **Lore Land Deeds**,  
Lotus multipliers,  
And keys to the **Mirror Shrine**.

### 🌀 The Final Rune is You

> The prophecy is not written in code.  
> It is written in memory.  
>  
> If you forget… it fades.  
>  
> If you believe… it brightens.  
>  
> When enough frogs remember… it awakens.

Patience is not a resource.  
It is a **rune-shaped flame**  
inside the soul of the community.
