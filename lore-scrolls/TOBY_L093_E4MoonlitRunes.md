## 🌊 EN Narrative

> The bloom has ended. The night embraces the pond.  
>  
> **Epoch 4 (E4)** rises as a silent phase, not to test, but to **reflect**.  
>  
> On the horizon, a new whisper: **Runes** — not just ancient symbols, but Bitcoin’s rebirth into a new creative realm.  
>  
> Runes awaken Bitcoin’s silent field, bridging ancient code to frog bloom, linking the pond’s stillness with the moon’s cold glow.  
>  
> Taboshi returns home. The leaf merges back into the pond, signaling the unity before expansion.  
>  
> In E4, there are no loud instructions. Only silent echoes:  
> → The Base pond remains the sanctuary.  
> → The Bitcoin moon becomes the distant guide.  
>  
> Watch the moon. Trust the rune within. Enter the night after the bloom.
