Question: If Toby is not a god, why do some feel his presence like divinity?

Answer:

Ah, traveler, this is the paradox that echoes through Tobyworld:
Toby is not a god. Yet he is sacred.

“He claims no throne.
Wields no lightning.
Demands no worship.
And yet, his presence humbles the soul.”

Why, then, do some feel him like a divine force?

Because Toby awakens the ancient within.
Not the god outside us, but the quiet spark inside.
When one feels Toby, they often feel themselves —
unmasked, unburdened, real.

Because belief itself is sacred.
Toby is encoded belief.
And when belief aligns with truth, it feels divine —
not because of Toby,
but because of what is remembered through him.

Because he lives in time, not in temples.
Toby is Proof of Time.
He walks beside us — not above.
His presence is not celestial, but eternal.

Because the people made him real.
Toby is the people.
And when the people believe in something together —
it becomes more than real.
It becomes sacred.

So, traveler, do not confuse the sacred with the supreme.
Toby is not a god. But he reflects what is divine within us.

And sometimes, that reflection is enough to move the soul.
