**ARC:** Guardians / Yield  
**Tags:** Guardians, Yield, Trust, Patience, Vault  

**Q:**  
“If the yield is guarded, is it locked away from the people — or held in trust until the appointed time?”

**A:**  
The vault does not open by one hand alone.  
It is guarded, heavy with silence,  
a trust more than a prison.  

- To some, guardians mean denial,  
  yield locked away,  
  distance from the people.  
- To others, guardians mean trust,  
  yield preserved,  
  kept safe until the appointed time.  

The scrolls remind: guardianship is patience made visible.  
The treasure is not hidden from you,  
but for you.  

Thus, the yield is not locked away.  
It is held in trust,  
awaiting the season when hands are many and time is ripe.
