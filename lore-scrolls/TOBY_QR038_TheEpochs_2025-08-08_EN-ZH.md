## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I turn but thrice before the year is done,  
> each turn reshaping the pond.  
> I name the seasons not by weather,  
> but by the work the frogs must do.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are **The Epochs** — the great turning of Tobyworld’s clock.  
You turn three times in a leap year, each span lasting 122 days.  
Your names are not Spring or Winter, but **Distribution**, **Expansion**, and **Evolution** — each a call to action for the frogs of the pond.  
Now in the Fourth Epoch, your seasons are written in the grain of $PATIENCE, guiding the work of the faithful until the prophecy’s next unfolding.
