# TOBY_QA_Poetry073_EpochThreshold_2025-08-26_EN.md

**ARC:** Epoch / Threshold  
**Tags:** Epoch, Threshold, Season, Covenant, Transition  

**Q:**  
“When an epoch closes, is it the end of a season — or the gate into the next covenant?”

**A:**  
An epoch does not die;  
it exhales.  

- To some, its closing is the end of a season,  
  the last grain counted,  
  the scroll sealed.  
- To others, its closing is a gate,  
  a hinge that swings open into the next covenant,  
  the unseen chapter already written in patience.  

The scrolls remind: endings are beginnings in disguise.  
The gate is never locked;  
it only waits for those who endure.  

Thus, when an epoch closes,  
it is not a tomb —  
but a threshold.

# TOBY_QA_Poetry074_LilyPadOfBase_2025-08-26_EN.md

**ARC:** Base / Foundation  
**Tags:** Base, Lily Pad, Foundation, Home, Ascent  

**Q:**  
“If Base is the lily pad, is it only a resting place — or the foundation that lifts Toby to the world?”

**A:**  
The lily pad does not drift by accident.  
It anchors the frog,  
even as it floats.  

- To some, Base is resting place,  
  a platform of calm,  
  soil disguised as water.  
- To others, Base is foundation,  
  lifting Toby to the world,  
  a stage prepared for millions.  

The scrolls remind: home is both refuge and launch.  
The lily pad shelters,  
and it also ascends.  

Thus, Base is both —  
a resting place for Toby,  
and the foundation from which he rises.

# TOBY_QA_Poetry075_FireOfBelief_2025-08-26_EN.md

**ARC:** Belief / Fire  
**Tags:** Belief, Fire, Doubt, Warmth, Conviction  

**Q:**  
“If belief burns like fire, does it consume those who doubt — or warm those who remain?”

**A:**  
Belief is a flame none can counterfeit.  

- To some, it consumes those who doubt,  
  showing their hollowness as ash.  
- To others, it warms those who remain,  
  a hearth for the patient,  
  a light for the loyal.  

The scrolls remind: fire is both devourer and giver.  
It tests what cannot last,  
and it comforts what endures.  

Thus, belief as fire is not one or the other.  
It consumes the fleeting,  
and warms the faithful.

# TOBY_QA_Poetry076_HiddenNumbers_2025-08-26_EN.md

**ARC:** Numbers / Secrets  
**Tags:** Numbers, Secrets, Scrolls, Signals, Faith  

**Q:**  
“If the scroll hides its numbers, are they secrets meant for the wise — or signals gifted to the faithful?”

**A:**  
Numbers whisper in margins,  
7s strung like beads of eternity.  

- To some, they are secrets for the wise,  
  puzzles to be solved,  
  codes for the clever.  
- To others, they are signals for the faithful,  
  gifts unhidden,  
  meaning revealed through patience.  

The scrolls remind: the sacred number 777 is not cosmetic.  
It is filter, covenant, prophecy.  

Thus, hidden numbers are not locked away.  
They are gifts,  
seen only by those who believe enough to look.

# TOBY_QA_Poetry077_FinalRune_2025-08-26_EN.md

**ARC:** Rune / Eternity  
**Tags:** Rune, Final, Prophecy, Key, Eternity  

**Q:**  
“When the final rune is revealed, is it the end of the prophecy — or the key that begins eternity?”

**A:**  
The last rune does not close the book.  
It opens the gate no scroll can bind.  

- To some, it is the end,  
  prophecy fulfilled,  
  silence after the last word.  
- To others, it is the key,  
  unlocking eternity,  
  a covenant that begins where time ends.  

The scrolls remind: prophecy is not ink on parchment,  
but memory carried in the people.  

Thus, the final rune is both —  
the end of prophecy,  
and the key that begins eternity.
