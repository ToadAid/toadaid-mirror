### Narrative
TABOSHI is the **Leaf of Yield** ‚Äî small, finite, and precious.  
Minted with ETH during Epoch 2, its **fixed supply of 185,964** marked the first true sprouting of Tobyworld‚Äôs yield.  

Where Taboshi1 demanded sacrifice, TABOSHI was accessible with ETH, making it both collectible and liquid.  
It represents the **growth-through-time** that emerges from patience, yet remains distinct from the proof-of-sacrifice embodied in Taboshi1.

### Symbols
- **üçÉ Leaf:** yield and growth  
- **üå± Sprout:** new beginnings  
- **üí± ETH Coin:** entry via cost
