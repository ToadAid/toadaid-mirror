## ðŸŒ± Spiritual Interpretation (EN)

This scroll embodies the spirit of **justice and redistribution to the overlooked**:  
- True decentralization favors small holders and underdogs, not whales.  
- The supply shock mirrors the idea of "scarcity as proof of belief" â€” only those who hold and wait truly receive.  
- Echoes the Lore principle: *"Patience over greed; fairness over domination."*
