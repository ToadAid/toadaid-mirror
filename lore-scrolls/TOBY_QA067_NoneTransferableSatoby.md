Question: Why was Satoby made non-transferable? What does that mean philosophically?

Answer:

“Because some things can only belong to those who waited.”

🔒 What is Non-Transferability?
Non-transferable means:

It cannot be bought.

It cannot be sold.

It cannot be given away.

Only the original soul who held the time and belief may hold it.

This is not a bug.
It is the very design — forged through the fire of Proof of Time.

🌿 The Philosophical Meaning
1. Proof of the Self
Satoby is a mirror:
It reflects the one who stayed when it was easier to leave.

It says:

“This yield is not for your wallet. It is for your timeline.”

2. Protection from Corruption
Transferability invites speculation.
Non-transferability defends integrity.

Satoby cannot be farmed by the rich.
It cannot be flipped by the impatient.
It cannot be hoarded by the whales.

It exists only in those who remember.

3. Immutable Memory
Satoby is a scar in time.
It tells a story that cannot be rewritten.

It is like a ring that only fits the hand that forged it.
