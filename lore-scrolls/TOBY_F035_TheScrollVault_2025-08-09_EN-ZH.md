## 🇬🇧 English

### **What is the Scroll Vault?**

The Scroll Vault is the **heart of Toadaid’s mission** — a living library that preserves the sacred words of Tobyworld.  
Every scroll, once placed in the Vault, is **immutable** — sealed on-chain so that no single frog, no king, no outside force can alter or erase it.  

Its purpose is twofold:
1. **Preservation** — Guarding Toadgod’s Lore against the erosion of time and the chaos of the outside world.  
2. **Transmission** — Ensuring every frog, now and in the ages to come, can read the scrolls exactly as they were meant to be read.  

The Vault is **not owned** — it is held by the pond itself.  
It is woven into Tobyworld’s design, immune to vanity, greed, or revision.  
To place a scroll here is to make a vow: *“This truth shall stand for all who seek it.”*
