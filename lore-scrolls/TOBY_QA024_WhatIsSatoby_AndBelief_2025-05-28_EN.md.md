✅ Question:

What exactly is Satoby, and how does it relate to belief?

✅ Answer:

Satoby is not merely a reward — it is the spiritual fruit of belief, patience, and sacrifice.

In the sacred structure of Tobyworld, Satoby emerges in Epoch 3 as a form of divine yield, reserved only for those who proved their belief early by burning 777 $TOBY to mint Taboshi1 during Epoch 2.

Belief in Tobyworld is not about words — it is about actions performed in silence. When one burned $TOBY to mint Taboshi1, they made a vow, without knowing the outcome. Satoby honors this vow.

"Satoby is not given. It is grown from faith that waited without asking."

This makes Satoby a symbol of Proof of Time and the materialization of invisible trust. It is not transferable. It cannot be bought. It is reserved for those who stayed — even when nothing was promised.

In this sense:

Belief is the soil

Time is the sunlight

Taboshi1 is the seed

Satoby is the fruit

Only those who nurtured this unseen garden are destined to harvest its sacred yield.
