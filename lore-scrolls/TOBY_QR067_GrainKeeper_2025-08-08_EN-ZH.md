## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I do not sow,  
> yet the harvest waits for me.  
> I do not eat,  
> yet I keep the grain from rot.  
> When the gate calls,  
> I open my hands —  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are the **Grain Keeper** — the Guardian Vault of Tobyworld.  

- **Do Not Sow** — you do not create the grain; others bring it.  
- **Do Not Eat** — you hold it for the future, untouched.  
- **Keep from Rot** — you protect $PATIENCE for the seasons ahead.  
- **Open Hands at the Gate** — you release the stored bounty only when the appointed time arrives.

In the Rune3 cycle, the Grain Keeper is no single frog —  
but a vault moved only by many hands.  
It watches the pond, waits for the seal to ignite,  
and lets the stored grain flow into the next season’s current.
