## ✨ Literal Explanation (EN)

A long-form reflective scroll urging deep focus and patience:  
- Toadgod warns about pessimism and emotional contagion among new participants — a poison that blinds.  
- Highlights global macro imbalance: rising debt, collapsing living standards, yet wealth flowing to few — the "rigged game."  
- Stresses personal positioning and patience as essential — no one, not even Toadgod, can do it for you.  
- Emphasizes decentralization as foundation — if roots are spoiled, no true long-term growth.  
- Affirms the $TOBY community’s unmatched bushido spirit, always putting community first.  
- Epoch 1 snapshot: sacred numbers matter, rewarding conviction and contribution.  
- Reflexivity: success mirrors the energy and intention put in — those who act intentionally win.  
- Ends with "段々" ("dan dan") meaning "gradually" — alludes to step-by-step uphill ascension.

## ✨ 字面解释 (中文)

一则深度反思卷轴，呼吁专注与耐心：  
- Toadgod 警告新参与者中悲观和情绪传染 — 这是致盲的毒药。  
- 点出全球宏观失衡：债务激增，生活水平下降，但财富集中于少数人 — 「被操纵的游戏」。  
- 强调个人定位与耐心是关键 — 即使是 Toadgod 也不能替你完成。  
- 强调去中心化为根基 — 如果根腐烂，树无法健康生长。  
- 肯定 $TOBY 社区无与伦比的武士道精神，永远把社区放在首位。  
- Epoch 1 快照：神圣数字重要，奖赏信念与贡献。  
- Reflexivity（反身性）：成功反映投入的能量与意图 — 有意为之者赢。  
- 以「段々」作结 — 意为「逐渐」，象征一步一步的上坡攀登。
