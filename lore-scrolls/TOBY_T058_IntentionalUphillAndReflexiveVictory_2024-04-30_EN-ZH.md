## âœ¨ Literal Explanation (EN)

A long-form reflective scroll urging deep focus and patience:  
- Toadgod warns about pessimism and emotional contagion among new participants â€” a poison that blinds.  
- Highlights global macro imbalance: rising debt, collapsing living standards, yet wealth flowing to few â€” the "rigged game."  
- Stresses personal positioning and patience as essential â€” no one, not even Toadgod, can do it for you.  
- Emphasizes decentralization as foundation â€” if roots are spoiled, no true long-term growth.  
- Affirms the $TOBY communityâ€™s unmatched bushido spirit, always putting community first.  
- Epoch 1 snapshot: sacred numbers matter, rewarding conviction and contribution.  
- Reflexivity: success mirrors the energy and intention put in â€” those who act intentionally win.  
- Ends with "æ®µã€…" ("dan dan") meaning "gradually" â€” alludes to step-by-step uphill ascension.
