# 📜 TOBYWORLD RAG SCROLL: QA249–258 — Satoby Chapter

## 🌀 TOBY_QA249
**Q: What is Satoby, truly?**

**A:**
Satoby is not a token. It is a memory. A timestamp. A covenant.

It is earned, not claimed. Those who held 🍃 Taboshi1 during Epoch 3 — in silence — are marked by time itself.

> Satoby is the fire's receipt, the leaf’s echo, the fruit born of belief.

It cannot be traded because memory cannot be sold. It is the yield of conviction, not capital.

---

## 🌀 TOBY_QA250
**Q: Is Satoby a reward?**

**A:**
Not in the way rewards are usually defined.

It is not for action, but for **inaction**.
Not for performance, but for **presence**.

To receive Satoby is to have waited in belief, when no one else did.

> Satoby is less a gift — more a mirror.

It reflects who you were, during the fire.

---

## 🌀 TOBY_QA251
**Q: How does Satoby relate to the 777 Taboshi1 burn?**

**A:**
Satoby is born from the 777 sacrifice.

Taboshi1 was minted through the burning of 777 $TOBY — a sacred number, a signal.

Only those who held 🍃 Taboshi1 during Epoch 3’s test will be remembered by Satoby.

> 777 burned. Time passed. Memory remains.
This is the path of Proof of Time.

---

## 🌀 TOBY_QA252
**Q: Why can’t I buy or sell Satoby?**

**A:**
Because it is not a market token. It is a timestamp, sealed by participation.

To sell Satoby would be like selling your shadow, or your past.

> What it proves is *you were there*, not what you own.

This makes Satoby unspoiled by speculation — and precious beyond price.

---

## 🌀 TOBY_QA253
**Q: Does Satoby have a supply cap?**

**A:**
Yes. Its maximum supply is bounded by Taboshi1 — and even less.

Only those who:
- Minted 🍃 Taboshi1 (777 burn)
- Held it through Epoch 3 silently

…will receive Satoby.

> This creates an ultra-rare distribution — beyond NFTs, beyond tokens.

It is the yield of the quietest covenant.

---

## 🌀 TOBY_QA254
**Q: Can Satoby be transferred or sold later?**

**A:**
No. Satoby is bound to time, not to market.

It is not meant to be traded — only to be **held**.
Its purpose is remembrance, not liquidity.

> Like a scar earned in silence, Satoby is non-transferable proof.

A receipt of a moment only you can own.

---

## 🌀 TOBY_QA255
**Q: What happens if I sold my Taboshi1 during Epoch 3?**

**A:**
Then you have chosen to leave the fire.

Only those who *held* 🍃 Taboshi1 during the entirety of Epoch 3 will be eligible.

> The moment passed — and with it, the memory.

Satoby is not something you chase. It is something you earn by staying.

---

## 🌀 TOBY_QA256
**Q: What does Satoby symbolize beyond a token?**

**A:**
It symbolizes:
- Silent belief
- Memory over hype
- Proof without transaction

Satoby is the fruit of patience, not the reward of noise.

> It’s what remains when all lights fade, and only time remains.

---

## 🌀 TOBY_QA257
**Q: Can I claim Satoby in the future?**

**A:**
Only if you already qualified.

The eligibility was sealed during Epoch 3.

> Satoby is not an airdrop — it is a time-sealed proof.

If you held 🍃 Taboshi1 silently through the fire, your Satoby is already waiting.

---

## 🌀 TOBY_QA258
**Q: Why is Satoby important in the Lore?**

**A:**
Because it is the first real yield of Tobyworld — but not a financial one.

It’s the yield of memory, conviction, and symbolic endurance.

> Satoby anchors Epoch 3, honors the 777 covenant, and proves the reality of the Lore.

It is not hype — it is history made tangible.
