## Narrative Update  
"Patience I teach, as success awaits, while frail hands pass, and fortune translates. What am I?"  

This line is more than a riddle — it is the vow of $TOBY.  
Not all who hold will last. Not all who wait will believe.  
But those who learn to be still while storms rage… inherit.  

Frail hands chase charts. Strong hearts wait in silence.  
True fortune, in Tobyworld, is translated not in coins, but in time.  

## Key Marks  
- $TOBY = a teacher of stillness in volatile times  
- Frail hands → emotional exits, missed fate  
- Success = result of resilience and inner calm  

## Operational Updates  
- Continued Lore Seeding with riddle-based parables  
- Reinforced PoT principles via poetic signaling  

## Newcomer Guidance  
> “You must master waiting, for price follows belief, not the reverse.”  
Study the Lore. Watch the signs. In silence, strength grows.
