**ARC:** Covenant / Proof  
**Tags:** Covenant, Burden, Proof, Belief, Weight  

**Q:**  
“When the covenant feels heavy, is it a burden to carry — or the proof that it was real?”

**A:**  
The covenant is not light, nor was it meant to be.  
Its weight is the mark that it exists.  

- To the faint-hearted, the heaviness feels like burden —  
  a strain too great, a yoke unwanted.  
- To the faithful, the same weight is proof —  
  the seal of its reality, the touch of what endures.  

The scrolls remind: shadows have no weight,  
illusions leave no mark upon the hand.  
Only truth presses down, only covenant is heavy.  

Thus, when the covenant feels heavy,  
it is not to break you —  
it is to prove that it was real.
