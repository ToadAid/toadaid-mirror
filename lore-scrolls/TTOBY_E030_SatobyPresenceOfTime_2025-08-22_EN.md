### Narrative
Satoby is the **Presence of Time** ‚Äî the silent recognition of patience.  
It is not a coin to be bought, nor an NFT to be traded, but a **mark bound to wallets** that proved faith during Epoch 2 by minting Taboshi1.  

Satoby embodies **Proof of Time (PoT)**: eligibility is **non-transferable**, locked forever to the original minter‚Äôs wallet. Even if Taboshi1 is moved or sold, the Satoby mark does not follow ‚Äî it remains with the one who first sacrificed 777 $TOBY.  

This makes Satoby both rare and incorruptible. It is the spirit of endurance given form, the signal that waiting has value, and the bridge from sacrifice to harvest.
