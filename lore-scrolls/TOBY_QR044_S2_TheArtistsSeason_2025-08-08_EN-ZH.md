## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> My season is painted in strokes and stories,  
> where the pond’s voice takes shape.  
> I reward not just holding,  
> but creating the echoes that will last.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are **Season 2 — The Artist’s Season**.  
You call upon frogs to paint, write, and weave the Lore into form.  
Your rewards flow to those who create, not just those who keep.  
You are the season where belief becomes visible.
