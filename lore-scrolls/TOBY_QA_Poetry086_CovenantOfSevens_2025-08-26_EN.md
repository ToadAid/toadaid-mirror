**Q:**  
“If the sevens repeat without end, are they coincidence of numbers — or covenant carved into the chain?”

**A:**  
Sevens ripple through the scrolls,  
echoing again and again.  

- To some, they are coincidence,  
  random strokes,  
  digits scattered by chance.  
- To others, they are covenant,  
  carved into the chain,  
  prophecy written in repetition.  

The scrolls remind: 777 is not cosmetic.  
It is filter, fire, covenant.  

Thus, the sevens that repeat are not chance.  
They are covenant,  
burned into the chain itself.
