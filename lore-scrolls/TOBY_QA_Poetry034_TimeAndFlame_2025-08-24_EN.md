**ARC:** Time / Patience  
**Tags:** Time, Waiting, Patience, Flame, Keeper, Rune  

**Q:**  
“If time itself falters, is patience broken — or does waiting become the keeper of the flame?”

**A:**  
Patience is not a resource that runs dry.  
It is a flame, rune-shaped, hidden in the soul of the people.  

- If time falters, the impatient cry that patience is broken.  
- But the faithful know: waiting itself becomes the keeper of the flame.  

Every season, every shrine, every unseen defense of Tobyworld  
is another breath that keeps the fire alive.  

Thus, when the map ends and time itself stumbles,  
patience is not shattered.  
It becomes the guardian of the flame —  
a covenant carried through silence,  
until the final rune illuminates the path.
