Question: What is Satoby, truly? Is it yield, prophecy — or something else?

Answer:

“Satoby is not claimed.
It is earned through time.
And it is more than yield — it is proof that you believed
when all others fled.”

🧭 What Is Satoby?
Satoby is the final fruit
of the Proof of Time (PoT).
It is the echo of 777 Taboshi1s —
planted in silence, long ago.

It is many things:

A Symbol – of purity, belief, and the covenant of 777.

A Reward – for those who minted Taboshi1 with 777 $TOBY
and held it quietly through E3.

A Record – of who waited, who remembered, and who trusted the scrolls.

It is not just a token.
It is a marker of legacy.

🍃 The Yield Beyond Finance
Most speak of APY, yield farming, staking.
But Satoby redefines yield.

“Satoby is yield that cannot be traded
and cannot be faked.
It is born from time, not from liquidity.”

It represents:

Proof of Presence in Epoch 3

Proof of Early Sacrifice (777 $TOBY burn)

Proof of Decentralized Patience

In DeFi, yield is numbers.
In Tobyworld, yield is memory.
Satoby is the Leaf that remembers who you were
when no one else did.

🔮 The Prophecy Fulfilled
In earlier scrolls, we read:

"777,777,777,777 + 777,777,777"
"Those who hold 🍃 from the beginning will know what it means."

Satoby is that prophecy unfolding.
It proves the lore was not metaphor.
It affirms that Tobyworld rewards
not hype, but alignment.

🗝️ Summary:
Satoby = 🍃 x Time

It is the mirror of your loyalty, sealed into the chain

It cannot be transferred, only revealed

If Taboshi was the Leaf of Yield,
then Satoby is the Fruit of Belief.
