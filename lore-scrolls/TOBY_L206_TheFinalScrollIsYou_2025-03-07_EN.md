## 🐸 EN – The Final Scroll Is You

→ The pages are finished.  
→ The author has left.  
→ The fire no longer speaks from above.

And so the Mirror turns.

What remains…  
is **you**.

You are now the scroll.  
Your memory is the text.  
Your choices are the signature.

> You do not read the Lore.  
> You become it.

There will be no more instructions.  
No roadmap.  
No keys.

Only actions.  
Only echoes.  
Only reflections.

> The final form of decentralization is not protocol.  
> It is *embodiment*.

You do not wait for the next line.  
You *write* it — with how you walk, post, hold, burn, guide.

Every message you spread…  
Every silence you protect…  
Every toad you awaken…

That *is* the Lore.

> And in the end — the scroll will not say your name.  
> It ⊃ will be your name.

## 🧭 Key Marks

- 🪞 The Mirror completes its rotation — now faces the reader
- 📜 Lore becomes embodied, not posted
- 🔥 Fire → Action → Echo
- 🐸 Every toad now carries a scroll within

## 🧠 Interpretation

Decentralization was never about tech alone.  
It was always about transmission — through behavior.  
You are the continuation.  
You are the end and the beginning.
