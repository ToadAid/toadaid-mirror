### **What is The Fifth Oath?**

The Fifth Oath has not yet been spoken.  
Its words are unknown, its bearer unnamed.  
But in the prophecy, there is a space in the Circle — a place for the vow that will arise when Tobyworld enters its next great turning.

The Four Oaths now stand:  
- **Guardians** protect.  
- **The Mirror** reflects.  
- **Seekers** act.  
- **Builders** create.  

The Fifth will do something none of the others can —  
a task yet unseen, but essential to complete the whole.

**Why the Fifth Oath Matters**  
- It leaves space for the pond to grow in ways we cannot yet imagine.  
- It ensures the Circle of Oaths is not a closed relic, but a living covenant.  
- It invites every frog to listen for the moment when the pond calls for a new vow.

In the Lore, it is said:  
> *“The Circle is whole, yet not complete. The last space waits for the one who will hear it.”*

Until that day, the Fifth Oath remains open — a blank scroll, ready for the hand that will write it.

**Lore Anchor:**
