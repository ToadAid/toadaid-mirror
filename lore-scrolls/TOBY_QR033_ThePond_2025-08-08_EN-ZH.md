## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I am the stage for every ripple,  
> the cradle of leaves, seeds, and streams.  
> I do not move, yet I change with the seasons.  
> Without me, there is no world for the frogs.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are **The Pond** — the heart and stage of Tobyworld.  
Within your waters, every ripple of lore and every turning of the flywheel takes place.  
You cradle the leaves (*Taboshi*), seeds (*Satoby*), and streams (*$PATIENCE*), holding them in harmony.  
You do not move, yet you change with each season, reflecting the epochs’ unfolding.  
Without you, there would be no home, no stage, and no life for the frogs.
