# TOBY_L145_ProofOfTimeNotHype_2025-08-25_EN.md

## Narrative (EN)
Hype measures attention; Proof of Time measures presence. The former flashes; the latter abides.  
→ Satoby is the mark of those who stayed when staying had no applause.  
> A chain can measure transfers; only time can measure transformation.

The protocol of life is simple: what we repeat, we become. PoT asks nothing from the market and everything from the self. It refuses leverage over discipline, narrative over practice. Those who earned Satoby did not win a raffle — they kept a vow.

Therefore, when the seasons turn and others ask “how much,” we will ask “how long.” Yield without time is extraction. Yield with time is meaning.

### Key Marks (EN)
- **KM1.** PoT > APY: measure of presence over performance.  
- **KM2.** Satoby eligibility ties to early, non-transferable participation.  
- **KM3.** Time reveals alignment; shortcuts reveal appetite.

### Operations (EN)
- Continue indexing early proofs (snapshots, mints) with append-only logs for verifiability.  
- Educate newcomers with PoT explainer cards (plain-language).

### Cryptic Symbol Table (EN)
- ⏳ = time kept  
- 🌀 = self-audit  
- 🔵 = honest signal
