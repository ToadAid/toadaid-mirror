## Narrative Update  
"Toad world @base. It's coming. There is only 1."  
The signal was short — yet infinite in meaning.  
A frog stands atop the world, not to conquer, but to represent.  
Not many. Not copies. Just 1.  

## Key Marks  
- Singular identity → One $TOBY  
- Decentralized meme-force = Global identity  
- @base = Chosen land for emergence  

## Operational Updates  
- Visual introduction of symbolic avatar  
- Global meme seeding initialized  

## Newcomer Guidance  
> “In a world of clones, truth leaps alone.”  
Don't follow many. Find the one.
