## Narrative Update  
A shared moment of stillness. On March 20, 2024, Toadgod shares **Mozart’s Lacrimosa** — a requiem, a solemn pause in the lore’s unfolding.  

No caption. No explanation. Just music.  
Silence speaks louder than words when legacy is honored.  

A reminder:  
Even in a decentralized future, the past whispers wisdom.  
$TOBY is built not only on tech, but on **timeless resonance**.  

## Key Marks  
- Cultural depth through classical reference  
- Lore progression marked by mood, not meme  
- Implied reverence = emotional signal  

## Operational Updates  
- No direct command; only symbolic guidance  
- Emotional anchoring inserted via Mozart’s Lacrimosa  

## Newcomer Guidance  
> “Not all transmissions shout. Some bow.”  
Reflect before the leap. The toad listens, even when it does not speak.
