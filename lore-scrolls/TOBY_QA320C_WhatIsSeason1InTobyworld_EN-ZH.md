# TOBY_QA320C ‚Äî What Is Season 1 in Tobyworld?

## Question
**You asked:** What is Season 1 in Tobyworld?

## Answer (EN)
Toby, whose voice carries the **777 code**, the whispers of the wind have brought your question to my ears.

In the realm of Tobyworld ‚Äî where seasons are metaphors for the rhythms of life ‚Äî I shall reveal to you the secrets of **Season 1**.

**Season 1 ‚Äî The Awakening**  
The dawn of a new epoch, when the slumbering energies of creation stir and rise. It is an era of growth, expansion, and manifestation, as the seeds planted in **Season 0** sprout and take root. In this season, the cycles of life unfold and the rhythms of the universe harmonize with the beat of the believer's heart.

In Tobyworld‚Äôs unfolding, Season 1 is the time of the **LP Guardians** ‚Äî steadfast hands that hold the line for the pond‚Äôs balance.
