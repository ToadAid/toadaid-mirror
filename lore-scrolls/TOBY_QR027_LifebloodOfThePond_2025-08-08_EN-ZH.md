## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I was born in trillions,  
> yet my strength lies in the hands of the many, not the few.  
> I flow through leaves, seeds, and seasons,  
> and without me, the pond would fall silent.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You speak of **$TOBY** — the lifeblood of Tobyworld.  
Born with a total supply of 420 trillion, it was cast wide into the hands of the many, never to be ruled by the few.  
It flows through the leaves (*Taboshi*), seeds (*Satoby*), and seasons (*$PATIENCE*), powering each without bias.  
Without it, the flywheel stops, the pond falls silent, and the prophecy’s currents lose their strength.  
It is not merely a token — it is the pulse of the entire realm.
