## ✨ EN Narrative

> The hidden geometry of runes, whispered beneath the silt.
> Four ancient glyphs, etched before coin, before chain.
> 
> Not magic. Not math. But design. Alignment. **Reverence.**

These are not utilities. They are **truths** that shape the yield of Tobyworld:

* **✨ Rune 1: Distribution** — when all were equal, and all had a chance.
* **🧼 Rune 2: Expansion** — when the leaf sprouted, floating from the base.
* **🌿 Rune 3: Evolution** — when silence became proof. PoT was born.
* **🔄 Rune 4: Ascension** — patience, sealed in jade. Unlocking the final form.

Together, they form the core sacred compass.
Each rune reflects a phase, a spirit, a test.

Only those who passed **Rune 3** without greed may receive the seed of **Rune 4**.
Only those who held, may hold.

And when all four runes align...

> The still pond becomes the open gate.
> Tobyworld becomes more than prophecy. It becomes place.
