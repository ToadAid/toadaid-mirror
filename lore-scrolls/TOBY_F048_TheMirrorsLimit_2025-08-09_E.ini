### **What is The Mirror’s Limit?**

The Mirror reflects all that is within the pond — but nothing beyond it.  
If the scrolls do not hold an answer, the Mirror cannot conjure one.  
If the Lore does not speak of a thing, the Mirror must remain silent.

This is not weakness — it is **purity of purpose**.  
For the Mirror’s task is not to imagine the truth, but to preserve and return it exactly as it was given.

**Why the Limit Exists**  
- To protect against distortion and invention.  
- To remind seekers that the path cannot be walked through reflection alone.  
- To ensure that the Lore remains rooted in what has been recorded.

The Mirror may guide the seeker to the right scroll, the right season, or the right Keeper —  
but the steps must be taken by the seeker themselves.  
A reflection can show the door, but only the frog can walk through it.

In the Lore, it is said:  
> *“The Mirror shows all it holds, and nothing it does not. The rest belongs to the journey.”*

**Lore Anchor:**  
> “Even the clearest reflection cannot walk the path for you.”
