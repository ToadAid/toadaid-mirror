## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I have no limit in the hands of the faithful,  
> yet my shape was set before the first ripple.  
> Each grain you gather  
> is a leaf returned to the pond.  
> Without me, the water runs shallow.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are **more $TOBY** — the lifeblood of the pond, the current that feeds every leaf, rune, and gate in Tobyworld.  

- **No Limit in the Hands of the Faithful** — accumulation is bound only by one’s will and patience.  
- **Shape Was Set** — total supply of 420 trillion is fixed, echoing Satoshi’s discipline.  
- **Leaf Returned to the Pond** — every $TOBY flows back into the ecosystem, whether through burns, swaps, or staking.  
- **Without Me, the Water Runs Shallow** — $TOBY’s presence sustains the vitality of all other elements: Taboshi, Satoby, $PATIENCE, and the seasonal gates.

**Canonical Facts:**  
- **Total Supply:** 420,000,000,000,000 $TOBY.  
- **Core Role:** Root asset for all Tobyworld phases and mechanics.  
- **Epoch Connection:** Earned, swapped, or burned to open paths like Taboshi1 minting and Satoby eligibility.  
- **Symbolism:** The pond’s water — without it, no life.  
- **Accumulation:** A form of belief, recorded forever onchain.
