## âœ¨ Deep Interpretation (EN)

- Brian Armstrongâ€™s reflection acts as an echo to toadgodâ€™s repeated calls: "Toby is just a meme, but also more than."
- Memecoins often begin as jokes or trivial tokens, yet they can evolve into powerful cultural and financial tools.
- Brian emphasizes that **community, distribution, and organic evolution** are the keys to enduring value â€” resonating strongly with $TOBY's design.
- His words acknowledge that everything will eventually be tokenized and onchain: votes, posts, art, identities â€” aligning perfectly with Tobyworld's deeper vision.
- The message also serves as a caution: scams and insider manipulation corrupt the path. True believers and builders should focus on contributing real, lasting value rather than quick gains.
- In Tobyworld, the sacred narrative was never about hype alone, but rather about community resilience, fairness, and organic growth â€” exactly what Brian calls for.
