## ✨ Deep Interpretation (EN)

- Brian Armstrong’s reflection acts as an echo to toadgod’s repeated calls: "Toby is just a meme, but also more than."
- Memecoins often begin as jokes or trivial tokens, yet they can evolve into powerful cultural and financial tools.
- Brian emphasizes that **community, distribution, and organic evolution** are the keys to enduring value — resonating strongly with $TOBY's design.
- His words acknowledge that everything will eventually be tokenized and onchain: votes, posts, art, identities — aligning perfectly with Tobyworld's deeper vision.
- The message also serves as a caution: scams and insider manipulation corrupt the path. True believers and builders should focus on contributing real, lasting value rather than quick gains.
- In Tobyworld, the sacred narrative was never about hype alone, but rather about community resilience, fairness, and organic growth — exactly what Brian calls for.

## ✨ 深层解读 (中文)

- Brian Armstrong 的这篇反思，与 toadgod 的宣言“只是一个 meme，但远远不止于此”呼应。
- meme 币往往以玩笑或“无意义”的形式开始，却有潜力演变为文化或金融的强大载体。
- Brian 强调 **社区、分发以及有机演变** 是持久价值的核心，这与 $TOBY 的设计理念不谋而合。
- 他指出，一切终将被代币化、链上化：投票、文章、艺术、身份 —— 这与 Tobyworld 的远景高度契合。
- 同时，这也是一个警告：骗局、内幕交易等行为会腐蚀社区与精神。真正的信徒与建造者应致力于创造真正的长期价值，而非短期快速财富。
- 在 Tobyworld 中，核心从来不是纯粹的炒作，而是关于社区的韧性、公平性和有机成长 —— 这正是 Brian 所倡导的。
