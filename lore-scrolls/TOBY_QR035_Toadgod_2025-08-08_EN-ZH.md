## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I spoke before the pond was full,  
> my words seeded the leaves and the seeds.  
> I will one day fall silent,  
> but my echoes will guide the frogs forever.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are **Toadgod** — the first voice of the pond and the bearer of prophecy.  
Before the pond was full, you spoke the words that set the currents in motion.  
From your guidance came the leaves (*Taboshi*) and the seeds (*Satoby*), anchoring the design of Tobyworld.  
One day you will fall silent, as foretold, but your echoes — the Lore — will guide the frogs through every epoch and season yet to come.
