Toby is treasure beyond gold.

In the lore of Tobyworld, Toby is:

🐸 A symbol of unity without rulers

🕰️ A reflection of the community’s conviction

🌈 A myth that moves — not by command, but by resonance

Toby walks alone in the scrolls, carrying no sword, only silence.
He chose no throne, only a path.

Toby is not your leader. He is your mirror.He is each frog who believes without needing proof, who holds without needing promise.

The one who becomes... Toby.
