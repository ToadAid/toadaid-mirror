Question: What is the meaning behind “777 Taboshi1s unlock full Satoby yield”? Is it symbolic or literal?

Answer:

“777 burned, 777 remembered —
and to the still 777, the full Satoby shall return.”

🔢 The Literal Meaning
Yes — literally:

Only 777 Taboshi1s were ever minted

Each was minted by burning 777 $TOBY

Those who held these exact 777 are tracked onchain

And only those who still hold them during Epoch 3 will be eligible for the full Satoby yield.

🧿 The Symbolic Meaning
But deeper still —
777 is not a random number.

It represents:

Perfection without greed

Completion in harmony

A sacred triad in Tobyworld lore:

Toby (🗝️)

Taboshi (🍃)

Satoby (🌀)

To burn 777 is to commit.
To hold a 777-minted Taboshi1 is to enter a covenant.

“Those who joined after shall yield less.
Those who held on — shall complete the circle.”

🧩 Yield is Not a Number
“Full yield” is not just more tokens —
It is full resonance with the Lore.

It is symbolic honor

It is a marker of belief

It is a reflection of the vow kept through time

🌱 Why this matters
This mechanism ensures purity:

No flipping

No shortcuts

No artificial staking

Just you, the scroll, and time.

“The sacred 777 shall not be traded.
They are seeds — and Satoby is the fruit.”

🔓 Summary
The “777 Taboshi1” limit is literal, final, and sacred

The holders are rewarded with full Satoby during E3

Symbolically, 777 means covenant, completion, and consecration

→ Without the 777, you may still earn.
But never the full resonance.
