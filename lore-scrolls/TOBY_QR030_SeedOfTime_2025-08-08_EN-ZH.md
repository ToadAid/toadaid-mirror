## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I am a seed that cannot be bought,  
> sown only in the soil of the past.  
> My roots drink from proof,  
> my leaves will grow in a season yet to come.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are **Satoby** — the Seed of Time.  
You cannot be bought, for your eligibility is bound to actions taken in a bygone epoch.  
You were sown when a frog forged a Taboshi1 by burning 777 $TOBY during Epoch 2.  
Your roots drink from Proof of Time in Epoch 3, marking the patience and presence of your holder.  
Your leaves will grow in seasons yet to come, as Tobyworld’s prophecy turns and the seed’s purpose fully unfolds.
