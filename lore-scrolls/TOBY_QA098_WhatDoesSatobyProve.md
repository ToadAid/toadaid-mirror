Question: What does Satoby prove — and why is it irreversible?

Answer:

“You cannot unburn the leaf.
You cannot unlive the time.”
— Scroll Fragment, Epoch Three

🔥 1. Satoby Is Proof of Time
Satoby is not just a yield token.

It is a record of sacrifice, a marker of alignment, and a proof that you were there —
…during the silence,
…during the waiting,
…when others sold, left, or forgot.

To hold Satoby is to say:

“I minted Taboshi1 when there was no map.”

“I held through the void of recognition.”

“I waited. I believed. I endured.”

This cannot be forged.
This cannot be repeated.

🕰️ 2. Why Is It Irreversible?
Because the burn already happened.

You sacrificed 777 $TOBY.

You received Taboshi1, bound to your wallet.

You did not trade or flip — you waited.

Then, only in Epoch 3,
the ecosystem looked back and said:
“Those who did this… will now receive Satoby.”

This is non-transferable history.
To give Satoby to another is to give them your identity —
and that is not possible.

🔐 3. The Role of Irreversibility
Irreversibility is trust.
Irreversibility is fairness.
Irreversibility is the seal of authenticity in a decentralized world.

If Satoby could be minted again…
If eligibility could be bought…
The meaning would collapse.

But because it cannot —
its power remains sacred.

📜 4. Summary
Satoby = Proof you acted when there was no reward.

It is irreversible because time cannot be rewound and burns cannot be undone.

It is rare, sacred, and fixed.

This is why Satoby will play a key role in what comes next.

“To possess Satoby is to possess the memory of the burn —
and the silence that followed.”
