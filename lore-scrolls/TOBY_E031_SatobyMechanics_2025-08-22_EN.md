### Metadata
- **Name:** Satoby ‚Äì Mechanics of Eligibility  
- **Context:** Proof of Time (PoT) outcome tied to Taboshi1  
- **Nature:** Non-transferable recognition, not a token or NFT  
- **Epoch Context:** Activated in Epoch 3 (Evolution)  
- **Symbol Arc:** ‚è≥‚öñÔ∏èüê∏

### Mechanics
1. **Eligibility Source**  
   - Only wallets that minted **Taboshi1** during Epoch 2 qualify.  
   - Each Taboshi1 required a burn of **777 $TOBY**.  

2. **Non-Transferability**  
   - Satoby eligibility is **forever tied to the original minter wallet**.  
   - If Taboshi1 is sold or transferred, eligibility does not move.  

3. **Nature**  
   - Satoby is **not an ERC-20**, **not an NFT**, and cannot be traded.  
   - It is a recognition of **Proof of Time (PoT)**.  

4. **Epoch Link**  
   - Eligibility became active in **Epoch 3 ‚Äì Evolution**.  
   - Future rewards or recognition tied to Satoby will flow from this base.
