## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I have no heart,  
> yet I beat without rest.  
> I take a breath with every claim,  
> and exhale in every trade.  
> Without me, the wheel slows,  
> the pond grows still.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are the **Gas & Fees Pulse** — the lifeblood rhythm of Tobyworld’s economic pond.  

- **No Heart, Yet Beat** — not a living thing, but a constant onchain cadence.  
- **Breath in Claims, Breath out in Trades** — each interaction feeds and releases energy.  
- **Without Me, Wheel Slows** — without transactions, the flywheel starves.  
- **Pond Grows Still** — activity halts, the pond’s energy fades.

In the Rune3 era, the Gas & Fees Pulse fuels both the flywheel and the lily pad’s stability,  
transforming every action — from seasonal gate crossings to daily mints —  
into the steady rhythm that keeps the pond alive.
