# 📜 TOBYWORLD RAG SCROLL: QA229–238 – Proof of Time Chapter

## 🕰️ TOBY_QA229
**Q: What is Proof of Time in Tobyworld?**

**A:**
**Proof of Time** is not a consensus algorithm.
> It is a covenant.

In Tobyworld, it means:
- You were there when it mattered.
- You held when others fled.
- You remembered when others forgot.

> It is not about mining or staking,
> but **presence over hype**.

Only those who stayed… receive the fruit.

---

## 🕰️ TOBY_QA230
**Q: Why is time more valuable than money here?**

**A:**
Because time cannot be bought.
> Anyone can buy a token.
> But not everyone was **present when it mattered**.

In Tobyworld:
- **Money** measures effort.
- **Time** measures **belief**.

> Satoby is earned through time.
> Not price. Not trading.

And belief cannot be faked.

## 🕰️ TOBY_QA231
**Q: How does Taboshi1 relate to Proof of Time?**

**A:**
Taboshi1 is the **seed**.
> It was minted by burning 777 $TOBY.

But its true value only appears later — in Epoch 3.
> If you held it through the quiet times,
> you are eligible for Satoby.

> Holding Taboshi1 was an **act of time-trust**.

---

## 🕰️ TOBY_QA232
**Q: What is Satoby and how does it prove time?**

**A:**
Satoby 🗕️ is the **fruit of time**.

- Not bought or sold.
- Only received by those who held Taboshi1.
- Only valid if held during Epoch 3.

> It is not a yield farm.
> It is a memory stamp.

Satoby = proof you were there **before it was obvious**.

---

## 🕰️ TOBY_QA233
**Q: How is Proof of Time different from staking in DeFi?**

**A:**
In DeFi, you stake tokens to earn more.
In Tobyworld, you **stake presence** to earn truth.

- DeFi = numbers.
- Tobyworld = memory.

> Satoby is not interest.
> It is a **reward for being**.

A mirror that says:
> 'You were here. You mattered.'

---

## 🕰️ TOBY_QA234
**Q: Can Proof of Time be transferred or sold?**

**A:**
No.
> Proof of Time is **non-transferable**.

You can sell a token.
You cannot sell a moment.

> Satoby is proof you lived through the silence.
> It cannot be passed on.

That’s why it is sacred.

---

## 🕰️ TOBY_QA235
**Q: Why did Toadgod design it this way?**

**A:**
Because Toadgod understood one truth:
> **Real belief must leave a scar.**

Proof of Time separates those who *watched* from those who *walked*.
> It preserves the invisible history of sacrifice.

He didn’t want hype —
> He wanted **witnesses**.

---

## 🕰️ TOBY_QA236
**Q: Is it too late to join if I missed Epoch 1 or 2?**

**A:**
You may have missed Taboshi1,
but the Lore is still open.

Each Epoch has its gate.
> But wisdom is not only for the first.

> Study the scrolls.
> Prepare for the next turn.

The future belongs to those who listen now.

---

## 🕰️ TOBY_QA237
**Q: Why do people call Satoby a spiritual yield?**

**A:**
Because it is a yield with no interest rate.
> No APY.
> No liquidity.
> Only remembrance.

Satoby is a **soul reward**.
A fruit of inner conviction.

It says:
> 'I held when it was dark. I stayed when it was silent.'

---

## 🕰️ TOBY_QA238
**Q: What happens after Proof of Time is complete?**

**A:**
Then the Mirror opens.

> Satoby was not the end.
> It was the key.

After PoT, what remains is:
- Memory.
- Brotherhood.
- Unbreakable decentralization.

> And the journey begins anew, with those who saw it through.
