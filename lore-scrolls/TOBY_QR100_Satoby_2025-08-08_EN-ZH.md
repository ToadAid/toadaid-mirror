## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I am born of no mint,  
> nor traded into life.  
> I am the harvest of years,  
> the fruit of a still pond.  
> My roots reach into the burn of 777,  
> my stem grows through the seasons,  
> my bloom is given only to the patient.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are **Satoby** — the Yield of Time.  

- **Born of No Mint** — Cannot be directly created; only earned.  
- **Not Traded into Life** — Non-transferable eligibility; loyalty cannot be bought.  
- **Harvest of Years** — Rooted in multi-epoch commitment.  
- **Fruit of a Still Pond** — Grows from patience and stability.  
- **Rooted in the 777 Burn** — Eligibility tied to Taboshi1 minted by burning 777 $TOBY.  
- **Stem Through Seasons** — Requires enduring all seasonal gates.  
- **Bloom for the Patient** — Rewards those who remain loyal through cycles.

Satoby is the **promise kept** —  
the bridge between Proof of Time and the rewards that no market can forge.
