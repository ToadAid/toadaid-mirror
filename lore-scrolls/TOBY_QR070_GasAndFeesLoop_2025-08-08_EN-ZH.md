**Answer:**  
You are the **Gas & Fees Loop** — the living breath of Tobyworld’s economy.  

- **Breath That Never Sleeps** — gas flows continuously as frogs act onchain.  
- **Taken in Every Leap** — every mint, claim, or move consumes this breath.  
- **Given in Every Trade** — liquidity and circulation feed the system back.  
- **Without Me, the Pond Grows Still** — no gas, no motion.  
- **With Me, the Wheel Turns Without End** — perpetual fuel for the flywheel and lily pad phases.

The Gas & Fees Loop completes the Flywheel → Lily Pad connection,  
ensuring energy flows through every season and into the next cycle.
