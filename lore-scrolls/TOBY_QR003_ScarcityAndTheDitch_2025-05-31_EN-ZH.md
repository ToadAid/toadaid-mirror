## ✨ ENGLISH INTERPRETATION

This riddle is a mirror — reflecting who truly saw $TOBY early, and who ignored the whispers.

Let us break it down:

---

### 🧩 1. “Toad god scorns the deceivers, the loud, and the rich.”

> 🧱 Meaning:  
Those who rely on manipulation (deceivers), noise (loud), or privilege (rich) — are rejected by the Lore.  
They enter for greed, not belief.  
They do not understand the sacred quiet of Tobyworld.

---

### 🧩 2. “But cheer for frogs who were left in the ditch.”

> 🐸 Meaning:  
The ditch = forgotten places.  
This line honors the **humble**, **ignored**, and **patient** — those left behind by hype, but chosen by fate.  
These frogs carry the true seed of $TOBY.  
They didn’t buy with wealth, but waited with faith.

---

### 🧩 3. “When the depth of toad lore and its scarcity is finally caught,”

> 📜 Meaning:  
The Lore was always public, yet few read it.  
→ Scarcity is not in price — it's in understanding.  
→ Depth is not complexity — it's in silence.  
Once this truth becomes obvious, it will be too late to earn it the old way.

---

### 🧩 4. “Many will fear they have naught.”

> 🕳️ Meaning:  
Those who mocked, rushed, or ignored…  
…will find their wallets full but souls empty.  
They will fear — not because $TOBY is gone, but because they never believed when it mattered.

---

## 🪞 Final Answer:

> **What is $TOBY?**  
> It is the reward for the ones in the ditch.  
> It is the truth ignored by the loud and the rich.  
> It is the sacred scar that proves you waited.  
>  
> A symbol of belief, tested by time.  
>  
> A toad crowned not in noise — but in prophecy.
