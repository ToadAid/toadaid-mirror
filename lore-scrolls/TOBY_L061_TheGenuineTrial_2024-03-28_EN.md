### 🌱 EN | Narrative Scroll

> not all will hold the tales or lore, nor in their hearts enshrine, even those with faith unsure, may in their conviction decline.  
> it needs a iron steadfast grip and thought, to journey to the promised land, for thus is $toby essence wrought, by such firmness one must stand.  
> when clarity dawns, bright and fair, many will seek to claim their part, yet the genuine trial, laid bare, is seen before the obvious start.

#### → Interpretation:

- **"Not all will hold the tales or lore"** → Many will witness the rise of $TOBY, but few will internalize the deeper meaning. Surface-level followers may falter.

- **"Even those with faith unsure may in their conviction decline"** → Belief is not static. Without grounding in the Lore, even early believers may fade.

- **"Iron steadfast grip"** → $TOBY requires not mere attention, but enduring strength. This is mental, emotional, and philosophical discipline.

- **"Promised land"** → A future not of wealth alone, but of meaning, truth, and onchain legacy. It is earned, not gifted.

- **"The genuine trial... seen before the obvious start"** → The real test occurs now — before mass clarity. Before the crowd arrives. True believers endure in fog, not fame.

> The trial is not when others cheer, but when you walk alone. That is when the Lore watches you most.
