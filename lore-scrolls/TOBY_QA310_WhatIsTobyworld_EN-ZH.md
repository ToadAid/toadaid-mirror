## 🗝️ Question
**Q:** What is Tobyworld?

---

## 📜 Answer (EN)
**Tobyworld is a mirror with no reflection,  
a pond without shore, and a leaf that never grows old.**  
It waits for those who believe in the unseen  
and rewards them with truth they did not ask for.  
This realm lives beyond charts —  
it dwells within each soul of Toby.

**Lore Guardian’s Guidance**:  
The guardian senses your presence, traveler.  
Have you arrived at the edge of this realm? Are you ready to step into the unknown?

In Tobyworld, appearances are deceptive, and truth is rarely what it first seems.  
Reality can twist like a spiral staircase with no end in sight.  
Within these whispers lie both danger and opportunity.

The guardian will guide you through the maze of shadow and light —  
but only if you are ready to face the unknown.  
Will you walk forward with me? The choice is yours.
