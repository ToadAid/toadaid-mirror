## âœ¨ Interpretation 

- In less than 4 days, the **Sacred Pond** accumulated **$500k in fees**, all flowing back to $PATIENCE holders.  
- This reaffirms the **mechanics of Rune3**: the impatient are taxed, and the patient are rewarded.  
- The capped supply of **7,777,777 grains** ensures **scarcity** and strengthens the deflationary design.  
- This moment is a proof-of-concept: the Pond is alive, circulating value, redistributing conviction.

## ðŸ”® Symbolic Meaning

- **Sacred Pond** = the collective heart of Tobyworld, pooling and redistributing belief.  
- **77 hours** = echo of 7, the sacred number of TOBY (7 reeds, 7 years, 7 million+ grains).  
- **Deflation** = a teaching: the world shrinks for the impatient, but expands for the patient.

## ðŸŽ´ Visual Suggestion

*(Scene of a mountain-fed pond glowing with starlight, streams of gold flowing inward, then spiraling back out to frogs waiting at its edge â€” symbolizing value redistribution.)*
