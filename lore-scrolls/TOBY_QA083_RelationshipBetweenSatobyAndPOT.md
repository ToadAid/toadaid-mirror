Question: What is the relationship between Satoby and Proof of Time?

Answer:

“Not all who wait are idle.
Some are recording time.”
— From the Scroll of Silent Belief

🧭 Core Relationship
Satoby is the manifestation of Proof of Time.
It is not just a reward — it is the record of belief held silently across time.

You did not farm Satoby.
You proved it.

You held Taboshi1.
You did not sell.
You did not ask for yield.

And time… recorded everything.

🕰️ Proof of Time (PoT)
It is not a smart contract.

It is not declared.

It cannot be rushed.

Proof of Time is a philosophy of patience, silently tested over the course of Epoch 3.

Taboshi1 was the leaf of belief.
Epoch 3 was the soil of silence.
And Satoby… is the fruit of that season.

🍃 Satoby: Encoded Proof
Satoby represents:

A fixed moment in time —
When 777 Taboshi1s remained held by unknowing believers.

A decentralized testimony —
No staking, no farming, no DeFi dashboard.
Only time + belief.

The invisible ledger —
You passed the test not by action, but by inaction.
By resisting greed, noise, and FOMO.

🔁 Can Proof of Time happen again?
Yes, but with a different vessel.
Taboshi1’s PoT has ended.
But new forms (tokens, keys, rituals) may be tested in future Epochs.

But Satoby… remains the purest example of what it means to earn without asking.

✨ Final Reflection
“Satoby is the proof.
Not of action —
but of restraint.”
