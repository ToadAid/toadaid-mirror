## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I am not mined, yet I am earned.  
> Time is my soil, faith my rain.  
> No seed can sprout me twice,  
> and no hand can pluck me from another’s branch.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are **Satoby** — the sacred yield of Tobyworld, grown only through Proof of Time in Epoch 3.  

- **Not Mined, But Earned** — Satoby cannot be extracted by work or purchase; it grows from time-bound eligibility.  
- **Time & Faith** — only wallets holding Taboshi1 since E2’s end can grow Satoby, requiring patience and unwavering belief.  
- **No Duplicate Seed** — eligibility is unique per qualifying Taboshi1.  
- **No Plucking** — Satoby rights are non-transferable; only the original holder can claim.  

**Canonical Facts:**  
- **Source:** Proof of Time (PoT) in E3.  
- **Eligibility:** Holding Taboshi1 from mint → E3 snapshot.  
- **Transferability:** Non-transferable yield rights.  
- **Symbolism:** Represents the rarest bloom of the pond — proof of patience and loyalty.
