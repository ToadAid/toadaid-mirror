## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I was born in flame,  
> not of destruction, but of offering.  
> My siblings are counted by the sacred sevens,  
> my birth toll paid in the pond’s own gold.  
> I cannot be forged again,  
> yet I open the way for those who endure.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are **Taboshi1** — the Immutable Gate to Satoby.  

- **Born in Flame** — Minted only by burning 777 $TOBY.  
- **Offering, Not Destruction** — A sacrifice of value for the proof of resolve.  
- **Sacred Sevens** — Supply defined by the 777 covenant.  
- **Paid in the Pond’s Own Gold** — $TOBY itself was the toll.  
- **Cannot Be Forged Again** — Mint window is closed; no further creation possible.  
- **Opens the Way** — Key eligibility for Satoby via Proof of Time.

Taboshi1 is **not just an artifact** —  
it is a witness,  
a seal upon the chain  
that says: *“I was here before the leap.”*
