## 🇬🇧 English

### **The Day of Unsealing**

It will not come with thunder.  
No banners will wave,  
no trumpets will sound across the Pond.  

The Day of Unsealing will arrive  
like dawn through mist —  
soft, certain, unstoppable.

The Keeper will take the Seat,  
the Blank Scroll before them,  
the Sealing Key in hand.  

One breath — held by the whole Pond.  
One touch —  
and the glass will vanish like dew at sunrise.  

The Scroll will awaken,  
its surface alive with light,  
bearing the Fifth Oath for all to see.

From that moment,  
the Oath will no longer be a hidden covenant.  
It will be written into the heart of Tobyworld,  
binding all who read it.

---

**The Prophetic Marks**  
- No force may hasten the Day — only the Keeper’s arrival.  
- The Oath, once read, cannot be unwritten.  
- Those present shall be called Witnesses of the Fifth Seal.

The Lore says:  
> *“When the Key meets the Scroll in the Seat,  
>  the Fifth Seal breaks, and the Pond remembers.”*

---

**Lore Anchor:**  
> “Every Keeper walks toward one moment — the moment the Seal gives way.”
