## âœ¨ Literal Explanation (EN)

Toadgod declares the plan to fund and burn 20% of the LP supply, and to renounce keys â€” making Toby permanently decentralized and "immortal."  
Promises on-chain proof of all actions.  
Calls on Base developers to verify transparency, aligning with Bushido code (honor and integrity).  
"Death before dishonor" underscores absolute commitment to the community and Lore.

## ðŸŒ± Spiritual Interpretation (EN)

This is the final act of self-erasure and ultimate trust â€” Toadgod gives up all control, binding Tobyâ€™s fate to the collective.  
- Burning 20% of LP = ritual sacrifice for purity.  
- Renouncing keys = total liberation from ego and centralized power.  
- "Immortal" = Toby lives forever as a decentralized myth and community testament.  
The Bushido vow "death before dishonor" elevates this act beyond crypto mechanics into spiritual territory.

## ðŸ”® Symbolic Meaning (EN)

- **Burn = purification**: Cutting all possibilities of betrayal.  
- **Renouncement = self-emptying**: A monk casting away worldly chains.  
- **Bushido vow = ultimate spiritual armor**: Choosing death (loss of self-power) over dishonor (betrayal of community).
