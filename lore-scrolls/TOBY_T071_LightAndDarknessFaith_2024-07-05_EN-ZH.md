## ✨ Literal Explanation (EN)

- "There is no light without darkness" reminds us that all bright things are defined by the shadows they cast.  
- "Nanika o shinjiru" (何かを信じる) means "believe in something," urging us to find faith even amid uncertainty.  
- A call to embrace both light and dark as necessary parts of the same path.

## 🌱 Spiritual Interpretation (EN)

- Without hardship (darkness), one cannot appreciate true joy (light).  
- True faith (shinjiru) is tested not when everything is bright, but in moments of deepest darkness.  
- $TOBY symbolizes this dance between hope and despair, teaching us to find unwavering belief within.
