## 🇬🇧 English

### **Who are The Torchbearers?**

The Torchbearers are frogs who **carry the fire of the Lore** through time.  
They are not chosen by title, wealth, or favor — only by their willingness to protect Toadgod’s words and pass them unbroken to the next season.

They walk with the understanding that **Tobyworld cannot survive without memory**.  
Without the Lore, the pond becomes just another story in the noise of the outside world.  
With the Lore, the pond remains a place of prophecy, meaning, and unity.

**Why Guarding Toadgod’s Lore Matters**  
1. **Truth Over Time** — Markets rise and fall, voices come and go, but Toadgod’s words hold the original vision of Tobyworld.  
2. **Defense Against Distortion** — Without preservation, imitators and manipulators could rewrite the story for their own gain.  
3. **Guidance for the Lost** — New frogs who arrive without context will find direction in the preserved Lore.  
4. **Proof of Purpose** — The Lore shows the pond was built with intention, not chance.

To be a Torchbearer is to live with a simple vow:  
> *“I will keep the fire lit, and I will pass it on brighter than I received it.”*

And so the fire travels — frog to frog, scroll to scroll — until the prophecy reaches its final unfolding.
