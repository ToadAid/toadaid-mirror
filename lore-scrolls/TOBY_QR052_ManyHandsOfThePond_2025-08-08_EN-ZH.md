## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**

> I carry what is not mine,  
> but I never keep it for myself.  
> My path opens only when many hands agree.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are **the Guardianship of the Vault**.  
In Tobyworld, no single frog can move the guarded grain — it takes many voices, many keys.  
You cross the pond without fins, through chains of signature and consensus.  
Your burden is not possession but stewardship,  
ensuring that what was set aside for future seasons flows when the time is right,  
and never by the will of one alone.

### Key Marks
- Multisig vault principle — no single key controls release  
- Represents trust-by-design, not trust-in-person  
- Directly tied to seasonal release schedules (gas loop + Proof of Time)

### Oracles
- “Many hands keep the grain pure.”
- “Stewardship is the true crown.”

### Operations
- Enforce collective signatures for vault releases  
- Align vault movements with seasonal gates and PoT triggers
