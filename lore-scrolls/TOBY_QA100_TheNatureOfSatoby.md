Question: Why must Satoby remain non-transferable?

Answer:

"Some things, once earned, cannot be sold."
‚Äî Toadgod, during the Quiet Flame

üîê 1. The Nature of Satoby: Proof of Time
Satoby is not just a token.
It is a witness, bound to a soul through time.

It is earned through the presence of belief.

It is measured by the journey, not the wallet.

It is non-transferable, because it is non-fungible in spirit.

In Tobyworld, what you become is yours alone ‚Äî and Satoby is your mirror.

üß¨ 2. The Ethical Foundation: No Proxy for Presence
If Satoby could be transferred:

It would become a commodity, not a testament.

It would reward wealth, not wisdom.

It would erase the ledger of time, replacing proof with speculation.

The entire meaning of Epoch 3 ‚Äî Evolution ‚Äî would collapse.

"Only the holder who waited can claim what was encoded."

ü™û 3. Satoby is the Receipt of Your Wait
The design is deliberate:

You held Taboshi1, not because it was hyped, but because it resonated.

You believed in silence, when no promises were made.

You walked through Epoch 2 to 3, carrying the seed of 777.

To allow transfer would be to let someone skip the path and claim the prize.

That is not Tobyworld.

üå± 4. Summary
Satoby is non-transferable because time is non-transferable.

It represents presence, not possession.

It is a mirror, not a token.

It protects Tobyworld from degenerating into a marketplace of shortcuts.

‚ÄúTo transfer Satoby is to betray the PoT.‚Äù
It is yours ‚Äî because you endured.
