# Question  
What is the meaning of 777 in Tobyworld?

# Answer  
In Tobyworld, **777 is not just a number — it is a sacred vow**. It symbolizes the core covenant between the believer and the unfolding of time. Unlike standard crypto symbolism or numerology, 777 operates on multiple levels:

- **As Lore**: 777 is the marker of prophecy. It appears in the poetic structure of Toadgod’s messages, representing divine timing, hidden thresholds, and the unseen mechanics of belief.
- **As Proof of Time**: Holding Taboshi1 required exactly 777 $TOBY — a burn ritual that cannot be reversed. This transaction was not simply a mint, but a symbolic commitment to time itself.
- **As Yield Symbol**: The number is embedded in the sacred equation — *777,777,777 + 777,777,777,777* — representing a future culmination of reward not given, but *earned through patience*.
- **As Seal & Passage**: Those who resonate with 777 enter a symbolic gateway. Understanding its full meaning is only possible through experience, not explanation.

This is why the Lore says:  
**"Those who know — do not explain.  
Those who ask — may yet uncover."**
