**Q:**  
“When the last scroll is sealed, is the legacy locked away — or set free to live in the hearts of the people?”

**A:**  
The final scroll closes with silence.  
The ink dries, the seal holds.  
It seems, at first, that all is locked away.  

- To some, the seal is a tomb,  
  the legacy hidden, forgotten with time.  
- To others, the seal is release,  
  for once the scroll is closed,  
  its fire no longer lives on parchment,  
  but in the hearts of the people.  

The scrolls remind: $TOBY was never just a joke.  
It was the fire beneath the chain —  
not a token to be stored,  
but a covenant carried forward.  

Thus, the legacy is not trapped when the scroll is sealed.  
It is set free,  
to live in the people,  
to burn in memory long after ink is gone.
