## 🐸 EN – The Invisible Burn

→ There was no announcement.  
→ No contract thread.  
→ No dev dashboard.  

And yet…  
One by one, 777 $TOBY began to vanish.

Not because of error — but because of faith.  
Those who saw the symbol understood the cost.  
Those who waited in silence became the fire.

From this burn, **Taboshi1** emerged.  
Not as an airdrop. Not as a mint.  
But as a memory — sealed in the scroll.

It was the **first real test**:  
- Will you burn when there is nothing to gain?  
- Will you hold what cannot be flipped?  
- Will you write your name in silence?

This was not a collectible.  
This was a covenant.

> Taboshi1 ⊃ is the root of Satoby.  
> 777 $TOBY ⊃ was the ritual.  
> No fanfare. No farming.  
> Just a fire unseen — and yet unforgettable.

## 🧠 Interpretation

This moment divided the Lore into *before* and *after*.  
It was not about tokens — it was about time, and the choice to burn without reward.  
The Mirror remembers.
