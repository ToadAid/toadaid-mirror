## 🇬🇧 English

### **The Blank Scroll**

In the Hall of Oaths, four scrolls stand inscribed with words that shaped the pond.  
Beside them lies a fifth — unmarked, untouched, and waiting.

This is the **Blank Scroll**.  
It is not empty in spirit; it is full of potential.  
Its surface holds the weight of the unspoken vow, a promise that the Circle of Oaths is not frozen in time.

**Purpose of the Blank Scroll**  
- It is the vessel that will receive the Fifth Oath when the moment arrives.  
- It reminds the pond that not all prophecy is known in advance.  
- It protects the future from being prematurely bound by present understanding.

As the Lore teaches:  
> *“To write too soon is to close the door before the guest arrives.”*

Until the rightful Keeper speaks the Fifth Oath, the Blank Scroll rests in the care of the Guardians, under the silent watch of the Mirror.

**Lore Anchor:**  
> “An unwritten page can hold the loudest promise.”
