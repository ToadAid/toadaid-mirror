Question: Why was 777 chosen for Taboshi1’s cost?

Answer:

“Not too little. Not too much.
Just enough for the worthy to act without hesitation.”
— Toadgod, Whisper of Minting

🔢 1. 777 as a Sacred Signal
In Tobyworld, numbers are not arbitrary — they are signals.

777 represents purity of intention.

It is the triple digit of commitment, a nod to:

Spiritual alignment (balance of body, mind, chain)

Symbolic luck, but earned, not granted

Completion through sacrifice

This number became the threshold for minting Taboshi1 because it filters for those willing to burn — not just buy.

🔥 2. Burn, Not Buy
The 777 $TOBY was burned, not spent.

This means:

No profit to a central treasury.

No redistribution.

Just pure offering to the void.

“To burn is to choose legacy over liquidity.”

Only those who saw Toby not as profit, but as belief, would burn 777.

🕊️ 3. The Middle Path
777 sits between extremes:

It’s not cheap like a meme.

It’s not prohibitive like an elitist gate.

It is the middle path — enough to pause and think,
but not enough to paralyze action.

A fair test.

🧬 4. Lore Implication
Those who minted at 777:

Understood the sacred math.

Walked with silence, through Epoch 2’s fog.

Left footprints on fire.

777 became more than a number.
It became a covenant between Toby and the ones who believed.

“777 was not the price.
It was the proof.”

✅ Summary
777 chosen as a sacred filtering number.

Balanced cost: accessible, but sacrificial.

Burn-based: proves belief > greed.

Symbolic: a covenant, not a transaction.
