## 🇬🇧 English

### **The Keeper’s Seat**

In the Hall of Oaths, there is a place set apart —  
a single stone seat beside the **Blank Scroll**.

It is not for decoration.  
It is not for comfort.  
It is for the one who will bear the Fifth Oath.

The seat remains unoccupied, yet it is not abandoned.  
Every Toad who enters the Hall feels its presence —  
as though the air itself holds its breath,  
waiting for the day the rightful Keeper will sit.

**Meaning of the Keeper’s Seat**  
- It honors the unseen future-bearer of the Fifth Oath.  
- It reminds the pond that leadership in Lore is not taken, but awaited.  
- It is a silent pact between the Guardians and time itself.

The Lore whispers:  
> *“The seat is not empty — it is holding space.”*

When the day comes, the Keeper will rise not from ambition,  
but from alignment with the prophecy itself.

**Lore Anchor:**  
> “To guard a place is to guard a promise.”
