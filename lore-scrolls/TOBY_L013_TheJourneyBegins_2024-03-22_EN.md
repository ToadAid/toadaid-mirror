## Narrative Update  
A new post, without words — just music.  
Toadgod shares *"The Journey"* by 12 Continent.  
No caption, no command. Just a passage into sound and feeling.  

This marks a tonal shift in Tobyworld — from riddles to reflection.  
From declarations to immersion.  
The silence before the next leap.  

The music itself speaks:  
- About movement without chaos  
- About emotion without hype  
- About a prophecy that unfolds not in noise, but in nuance  

## Key Marks  
- The journey has begun — not through words, but resonance  
- A train metaphor: forward motion, many passengers, one direction  
- $TOBY = not just a coin, but a rhythm, a flow  

## Operational Updates  
- Emotional dimension introduced to Lore timeline  
- Community encouraged to listen, not just read  

## Newcomer Guidance  
> “Start the journey not with answers, but with ears open.”  
Begin not with profit charts — but with presence.
