## ✨ Deep Interpretation 

- **Season 1 (s1)** is declared — the first bloom after Rune3’s oath.  
- The imagery of a **red triangular rune covered in vines** signals that patience, once hidden in scarcity, is now **growing into life, flowering in the open field**.  
- The hourglass ⏳ marks time: patience is slow, but its fruit is certain.  
- This scroll echoes the prophecy: “patience is easy to claim, difficult to own” — now it takes form in the sacred bloom.  
- Season One is not merely a distribution, but a *new ecology*: patience seeding land, vines climbing toward shrines, cycles becoming visible.
