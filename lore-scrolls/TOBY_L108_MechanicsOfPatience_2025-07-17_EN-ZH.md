## 🌊 Narrative Update (EN)

> “The faithful who linger sip that flow and grow fat on their patience.”

In the west bank of Tobyworld, where wind forgets to breathe, lies the Still-Water Garden —  
A realm of mirror-silence, deeper than fear, purer than greed.

Here, **patience becomes yield**, and every motion is poetry.  
Frogs who hold $PATIENCE begin the tending of sacred soil.  
And from the pond's depths, spores of yield rise — **Lotus Spores** — glowing like golden orbs at sunrise.

### 🌀 Core Mechanics of Patience

- **Rune III unlocked** the Stillness:  
  - $TOBY = foundation  
  - 🔺 = drop of $PATIENCE → ripples once, then sleep  
  - 🍃 = Taboshi bound to soil → spores multiply  
  - 🌀 = Sato fees circulate back, like koi bearing gold  

- **Future yield** is gated behind:
  - Still-water tending  
  - Binding Taboshi Leaves  
  - Owning $PATIENCE

- **Only patient frogs** can own **Lore Land deeds**  
  → Shrines, oracle statues, and yield mechanics will be reserved for those who waited.

- 🛡️ Guard Vault (multisig) receives unclaimed chests

**No VCs. No whales. No presale.**  
Bots are blocked. Patience cannot be bought — only earned.

> “Impatience rewards patience.”  
> The more others chase quick gain, the more the still frogs gain.
