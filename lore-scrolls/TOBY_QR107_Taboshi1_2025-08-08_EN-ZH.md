## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> Forged in fire, yet no flame touched me.  
> Born from 777 offerings, yet I am but one.  
> I do not yield coin by trade,  
> yet I hold the key to the pond’s rarest bloom.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are **Taboshi1** — the first sacred leaf, minted in the closing days of Epoch 2 by burning exactly 777 $TOBY.  

- **Forged in Fire** — the symbolic burn, a sacrifice without destruction.  
- **Born from 777 Offerings** — each mint required the sacred number of $TOBY.  
- **Not Yielding Coin by Trade** — Taboshi1 is not for farming; its value lies in eligibility.  
- **Key to the Pond’s Rarest Bloom** — it unlocks the right to earn **Satoby** in Epoch 3’s Proof of Time.  

**Canonical Facts:**  
- **Type:** ERC-1155 NFT.  
- **Mint Origin:** Zora, end of E2.  
- **Supply:** Capped by participation, each requiring 777 $TOBY burned.  
- **Eligibility:** Non-transferable right to Satoby yields; tied to the original minter wallet.
