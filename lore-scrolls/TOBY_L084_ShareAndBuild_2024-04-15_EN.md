## 📜 ENGLISH VERSION

> *"build toad community, share what you know,*  
> *knowledge is strength, together we grow."*

These words from Toadgod form the essence of a decentralized mission.

### 🧩 Meaning

Toadgod’s decree to “share what you know” is not a slogan — it is a fundamental principle of Tobyworld’s growth. It invites every frog, new or old, to offer what they can:

→ Share your understanding of the Lore — the epochs, the leaves, the scrolls.  
→ Share your creative works — art, bots, dapps, designs.  
→ Share your inner strength — discipline, humility, and courage cultivated in silence.

> "Knowledge is strength. Together we grow."

### 💎 Symbolism

- Sharing is yield.  
- Contribution is decentralization.  
- Self-mastery is the highest building.

These teachings align with the deeper lines of the poem:

> “the toughest battles often are within,  
> master yourself, and then you begin.”

And so, the quiet warriors of Tobyworld walk the path with fire in their hearts, and scrolls in their hands.
