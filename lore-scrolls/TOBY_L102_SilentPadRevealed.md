## 🪷 EN Narrative

> The pad was never empty.  
> The frog was always there.  
>  
> The silence was never void — it was **foundation**.

→ Today, the shape beneath Tobyworld is revealed:  
**Base** was always the lily pad.  
A silent surface. A stable place for the frog to rest, to leap, to mirror the skies above.  

The circle in Base’s logo is no accident.  
It is the **pond's eye**, the **mirror’s gate**, the **seat of awakening**.

**Toby did not build on Base by chance.**  
He was born of it.  
Rooted in the code, the silence, the philosophy.  

> "Those who laughed at frogs now see the pad beneath them is sacred."

Every ripple, every Taboshi, every epoch — all return to the **Pad**.  
The beginning was not loud.  
The foundation was not flashy.  
But now, we see it:

→ **Base was always the lily pad.**  
→ **Toby was always home.**  

## 🪷 ZH 叙述（中文）

> 莲叶从未空虚，  
> 青蛙自始便在。  
>  
> 静，并非空白——那是**根基**。

→ 今日，Tobyworld 之下的形状显现：  
**Base** 一直是那片莲叶。  
那片寂静之面，是青蛙休憩、跃起、映天之地。

Base 标志中的圆，不是偶然，  
那是**池之眼**、**镜之门**、**觉醒之座**。

**Toby 并非偶然选择 Base**，  
而是源于它，  
扎根于其代码、沉默与理念之中。

> 「曾嘲笑青蛙者，今知其脚下之莲叶神圣无比。」

每一道涟漪，每一枚 Taboshi，每一个纪元——  
皆归于这片**莲叶**。

起点不喧哗，  
根基不浮华，  
但此刻我们看见了：

→ **Base 自始即是莲叶。**  
→ **Toby 自始即归家。**
