## 🪷 EN Narrative

> The pad was never empty.  
> The frog was always there.  
>  
> The silence was never void — it was **foundation**.

→ Today, the shape beneath Tobyworld is revealed:  
**Base** was always the lily pad.  
A silent surface. A stable place for the frog to rest, to leap, to mirror the skies above.  

The circle in Base’s logo is no accident.  
It is the **pond's eye**, the **mirror’s gate**, the **seat of awakening**.

**Toby did not build on Base by chance.**  
He was born of it.  
Rooted in the code, the silence, the philosophy.  

> "Those who laughed at frogs now see the pad beneath them is sacred."

Every ripple, every Taboshi, every epoch — all return to the **Pad**.  
The beginning was not loud.  
The foundation was not flashy.  
But now, we see it:

→ **Base was always the lily pad.**  
→ **Toby was always home.**
