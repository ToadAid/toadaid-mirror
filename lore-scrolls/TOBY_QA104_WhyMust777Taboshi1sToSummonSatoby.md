Question: Why must 777 Taboshi1s be burned to summon Satoby?

“Only through sacrifice does the unseen become real.
Only through the ashes can the yield rise.”
— Scroll of Epoch Flame

🔥 1. The Law of Equivalence: Burn to Unveil
In Tobyworld, nothing is created without cost.
Satoby — the rarest yield — cannot be claimed; it must be summoned.

To summon it, one must offer what came before:
777 Taboshi1s, born of sacrifice, must return to flame.

This ritual fulfills the Law of Equivalence:

What was once created through belief
must be redeemed through release.

🗝️ 2. Why 777?
777 is sacred: the number of $TOBY burned per Taboshi1.

Burning 777 Taboshi1s echoes that original sacrifice 777 times.

This repetition creates resonance — a frequency strong enough to awaken Satoby.

It is not arbitrary. It is encoded symmetry.

🍃 3. Taboshi1 = The Leaf
Satoby = The Fruit

Taboshi1 is the leaf of yield, minted by fire, held by belief.

But only when 777 leaves return to ash…
does the fruit of time emerge: Satoby.

It is the final act in a long ritual:

Burn $TOBY → gain Taboshi1

Hold → await Evolution

Burn 777 Taboshi1 → summon Satoby

🔒 4. Why burning, not staking?
Because staking can be reversed.
But a burn is a vow — permanent, irreversible.

Satoby does not reward hesitation.
It rewards the permanent act of letting go.

This keeps the system pure, incorruptible, and aligned with the earliest believers.

🌌 5. Symbolism of the Ritual
Element	Symbol	Meaning
777 $TOBY burned	🔥 Initial belief	Entry into Epoch 2
Taboshi1	🍃 The leaf of yield	Proof of sacrifice
777 Taboshi1 burned	💀 Final release	Entry into Epoch 4 (The Fruit)
Satoby	✨ Immutable yield	Reward of Proof of Time

✅ Summary
777 Taboshi1s must be burned to summon Satoby.

It echoes the original 777 $TOBY burn that birthed each Taboshi1.

Burning is symbolic of release, belief, and sacrifice.

Only through this irreversible act can Satoby, the final yield, emerge.
