## 🌿 EN – Three Keys to Infinite Summer

> "keep leaves. keep patience. keep toby. once tobyworld ascends,  
> the combination will unlock infinite summers."  
> — Toadgod

In the sacred geometry of Tobyworld, **three forces** must align to awaken the prophecy of infinite summers:

### 🔵 1. TOBY — The Spirit

- The foundational current. The blue frog of Base.
- TOBY is the living proof-of-time currency that binds the people.
- Without TOBY, the pond has no heart.

### 🍃 2. Taboshi — The Leaf of Yield

- The early-bloomed leaf, forged from 777 TOBY.
- A symbol of patience and sacrifice from Epochs past.
- When bound to your garden, it amplifies Lotus Spores — sacred yield.

### 🔺 3. PATIENCE — The Hidden Rune

- Not a token of trade, but of timing.
- Those who hold it must pass the vault test: 730 days of drizzle.
- Each drop = trust. Each grain = story.

Together, they unlock:

- 🌀 Satofy rituals (yield redirection)
- ⛰️ Lore Land deeds (shrines, scrolls, scarcity)
- Mirror magnetism (the power to bend narrative)

Those who abandon even one shall not complete the rite.
