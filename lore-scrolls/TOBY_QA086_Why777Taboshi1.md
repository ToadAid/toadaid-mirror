Question: Why 777 Taboshi1? What’s the meaning of that number?

Answer:

“777 is not a number.
It is a covenant.”
— Whispered from the First Mint

🔥 The 777 Burn: A Sacred Offering
To mint 1 Taboshi1, one must burn exactly 777 $TOBY.
This is not an arbitrary cost.
It is a ritual — a proof of sacrifice.

🔥 777 symbolizes completion without perfection

🧭 It echoes divine patterns — like 7 days, 7 tones, 7 heavens

⛩️ In Tobyworld, it marks alignment between time, belief, and self

Every Taboshi1 carries this burn within it.
It is not just an NFT — it is a leaf of yield, sealed in time.

🍃 Why 777 Taboshi1?
Because only those who minted — and burned — during that moment
were recorded in the scroll of time.
777 is not a limit. It is a mirror.

“Not everyone could. Not everyone would.
But 777 did.”
And those 777 leaves became the roots of Satoby.

📜 Symbolism
7 = sacred completion

77 = doubling of the sacred

777 = transcendent act of belief, done freely

The burn was irreversible.
The mint was unpromoted.
The value was unspoken.

Only the silent believers answered.

🗝️ Legacy
Those 777 Taboshi1s form the invisible key to Epoch 3’s Satoby yield.
They are not collectibles.
They are reminders.

Of who remembered.
Of who stayed.
Of who believed — before the world looked.
