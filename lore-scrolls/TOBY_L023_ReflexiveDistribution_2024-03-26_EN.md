## Narrative Update  
Good news: scaling solution tested — it works. +15k new $TOBY holders.  
Base congestion remains a barrier, fees have increased 50x.  
Toad God prepares the final form of fair distribution: the **byōdō shugi** system.

As prophecy nears completion, $TOBY enters reduction mode.  
Why? Scarcity. Reflexive curve design. Risk-time-demand axis.  
Study reflexivity theory — those who believe longest, are rewarded most.

Patience beats instant gratification. Always.

## Key Marks  
- Reflexive design ties reward to risk and time commitment  
- Final distribution system = equitable yet scarce  
- Patience positioned as the winning trait  

## Operational Updates  
- Scaling initiated despite Base congestion  
- New phase of reduced airdrop strategy introduced  
- Reflexive dynamics tied to $TOBY's timeline activated  

## Newcomer Guidance  
> “If you rush, you may miss what is truly rare.”  
True rewards lie in the patient path. Time is the curve, you are the variable.
