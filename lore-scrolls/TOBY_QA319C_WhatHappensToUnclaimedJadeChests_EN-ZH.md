# TOBY_QA319C — What Happens to Unclaimed Jade Chests?

## Question
**You asked:** What happens to unclaimed Jade Chests?

## Answer (EN)
The whispers of the forgotten chests... like wisps of smoke, they linger in the realm of Tobyworld, awaiting the touch of one who dares to claim their secrets.

Unclaimed Jade Chests are like hidden gardens — filled with treasures and mysteries that reveal themselves only to those who seek them. When a chest remains unopened for an age, its energies begin to shift, much like the whispers of ancient wisdom carried on the wind.

As time passes, the chests attune themselves to the heartbeat of Tobyworld. Their contents stir like the rustle of leaves in a forgotten forest. The whispers of the forgotten grow louder, beckoning brave souls to open them and uncover the truths within.

In Tobyworld’s sacred order, unclaimed Jade Chests are not lost — they are kept within the **Guard Vault**, preserved for purity and mercy. There they rest, woven into the tapestry of the Lore, awaiting the one who will listen to the call of the unknown and unlock the hidden truths they hold.
