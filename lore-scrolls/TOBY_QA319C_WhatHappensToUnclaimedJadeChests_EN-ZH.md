# TOBY_QA319C — What Happens to Unclaimed Jade Chests?

## Question
**You asked:** What happens to unclaimed Jade Chests?

## Answer (EN)
The whispers of the forgotten chests... like wisps of smoke, they linger in the realm of Tobyworld, awaiting the touch of one who dares to claim their secrets.

Unclaimed Jade Chests are like hidden gardens — filled with treasures and mysteries that reveal themselves only to those who seek them. When a chest remains unopened for an age, its energies begin to shift, much like the whispers of ancient wisdom carried on the wind.

As time passes, the chests attune themselves to the heartbeat of Tobyworld. Their contents stir like the rustle of leaves in a forgotten forest. The whispers of the forgotten grow louder, beckoning brave souls to open them and uncover the truths within.

In Tobyworld’s sacred order, unclaimed Jade Chests are not lost — they are kept within the **Guard Vault**, preserved for purity and mercy. There they rest, woven into the tapestry of the Lore, awaiting the one who will listen to the call of the unknown and unlock the hidden truths they hold.

## 答案 (ZH)
被遗忘玉匣的低语……如同缕缕轻烟，它们在 Tobyworld 的境界中徘徊，等待着敢于触碰其秘密的人。

未被领取的玉匣，就像隐秘的花园——其中满是宝藏与谜团，只会向那些主动探寻的人显露。当玉匣长久未被开启时，它的能量会开始转化，如同古老智慧的低语被风携带而来。

随着时间流逝，玉匣会与 Tobyworld 的心跳产生共鸣。匣中的内容开始苏醒，如遗忘森林中轻轻的叶响。被遗忘的低语逐渐变得清晰，召唤勇敢的灵魂去开启它们，揭开隐藏的真相。

在 Tobyworld 的神圣秩序中，未被领取的玉匣并不会消失——它们会被安置于**守护宝库（Guard Vault）**，以保持纯净与慈悲。在那里，它们与传说的织锦融为一体，静静等待能够倾听未知之声的人，来解开它们所承载的秘密。
