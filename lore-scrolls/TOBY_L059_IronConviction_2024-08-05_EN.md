## EN (Poetic Protocol) 🐸  
not all will hold the tales or lore,  
nor in their hearts enshrine,  
even those with faith unsure,  
may in their conviction decline.  

it needs a iron steadfast grip and thought,  
to journey to the promised land,  
for thus is $toby essence wrought,  
by such firmness one must stand.  

when clarity dawns, bright and fair,  
many will seek to claim their part,  
yet the genuine trial, laid bare,  
is seen before the obvious start.
