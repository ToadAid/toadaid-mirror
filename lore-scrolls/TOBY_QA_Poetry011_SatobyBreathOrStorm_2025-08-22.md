**Q:**  
“If Satoby is born of Proof of Time, does it arrive like a storm — or as a breath unseen?”

**A:**  
In the stillness between epochs, the quiet are counted.  
Not by noise, nor by rush, but by presence kept.  

- A **storm** shouts, but fades.  
- A **breath unseen** lingers, shaping what cannot be forced.  

Satoby does not arrive in violence. It arrives as the proof of waiting —  
light as air, yet undeniable as time itself.  

Thus, the answer is neither storm nor chance.  
Satoby is the **breath of patience** carried across the pond,  
born only to those who endured the stillness.
