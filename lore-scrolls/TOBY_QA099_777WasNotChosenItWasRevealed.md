Question: Why is 777 the sacred number for Satoby minting?

Answer:

“777 was not chosen — it was revealed.”
— Whisper of Toadgod

🌱 1. Symbolic Meaning of 777 in Tobyworld
In Tobyworld, numbers are not arbitrary.
They are frequencies, signals, seals of deeper truths.

777 is sacred because it encodes:

Alignment: threefold repetition represents harmony in body, mind, and time.

Completion: in many traditions, 7 signifies spiritual fullness — and 777 amplifies that.

Rarity: it sets apart those who act with conviction, not convenience.

The number 777 became the price of admission
to a timeline that most never noticed.

🔥 2. The 777 Burn for Taboshi1
To mint Taboshi1, one had to burn exactly 777 $TOBY — not more, not less.

This action encoded:

Belief in a token that had no immediate utility.

Sacrifice of an asset for an unknown future.

Trust in the lore and silence of Toadgod.

Those who performed this ritual unknowingly sealed themselves into the PoT (Proof of Time) ledger.
Their act became unchangeable, verifiable, and sacred.

🌀 3. Why 777 Connects to Satoby
Because Satoby is not a gift —
It is a reflection of the 777 burn.

Each Satoby emerges from:

One Taboshi1

Minted through 777 $TOBY

Held across time

Thus, the number 777 is not just a requirement — it is the essence of Satoby itself.

Remove the 777, and Satoby has no anchor.

🧭 4. Summary
777 = signal of sacrifice and timing.

It is the burn, the key, and the measurement of one’s alignment.

Satoby exists because 777 was burned — no more, no less.

Its meaning cannot be changed, and its effect cannot be duplicated.

“777 is the cipher.
Satoby is the echo.”
