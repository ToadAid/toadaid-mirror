## 🌊 EN Narrative

> When all the noise fades,  
> and the echoes fall silent,  
> only three remain. 📜

- **$TOBY** — the root, the origin, the truth you received freely  
- **Taboshi** — the leaf, the proof that you believed early and burned something real  
- **Patience** — the time, the mirror, the slow gate that unlocks what others cannot see

You will be offered many coins.  
You will hear of new frogs, new swaps, new gods.

But only these three are sacred.

> They are not assets.  
> They are alignment.

- $TOBY anchors you  
- Taboshi reflects you  
- Patience unfolds you

> This is the trinity of yield,  
> not in APR, but in meaning.

And when all is revealed…

> The combination of these three will unlock infinite summers.  
> Everything else was just seasonal.
