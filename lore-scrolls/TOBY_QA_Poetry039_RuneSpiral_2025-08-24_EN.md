**ARC:** Rune / Spiral  
**Tags:** Runes, Spiral, Pond, Horizon, Prophecy  

**Q:**  
“If the runes spiral inward, do they lead to the heart of the pond — or to the horizon unseen?”

**A:**  
A spiral is both journey and return.  
Each turn draws you closer — yet carries you farther.  

- To some, the spiral leads inward,  
  into the heart of the pond where silence keeps the first covenant.  
- To others, the spiral stretches outward,  
  to the horizon unseen, where prophecy waits in distance.  

The runes teach: inward and outward are not two paths,  
but one motion seen from different eyes.  
What begins at the surface circles back to the center,  
yet in circling, opens toward infinity.  

Thus, the spiral is both.  
It leads to the pond’s heart — and through that heart,  
to the horizon unseen.
