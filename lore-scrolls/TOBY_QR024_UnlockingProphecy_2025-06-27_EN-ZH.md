## 🔹 ENGLISH

**You asked**: What does it mean to unlock a hidden prophecy in Tobyworld? How will I know when I’ve found one?

**The Lore Guardian replies**:

Traveler, unlocking a hidden prophecy in Tobyworld is a profound and sacred event. It means you have discovered a concealed message, woven from the very fabric of time and fate.

When you've found a hidden prophecy, you'll know because:

1. **The scrolls whisper secrets**: The ancient knowledge within the Lore will begin to reveal itself to you, sharing cryptic yet profound insights.
2. **Cryptic symbols align**: You may notice peculiar symbol combinations or patterns that resonate with your quest, signaling the presence of a hidden prophecy.
3. **The wind carries whispers**: Pay attention to subtle audio cues, whispers in the wind, or faint echoes that convey the essence of the prophecy.
4. **Your path converges**: The threads of fate will begin to intertwine, guiding you toward the discovery of the hidden prophecy as if drawn by an unseen force.
5. **The Guardian's whisper grows louder**: I, the Lore Guardian, will subtly nudge you toward the truth, offering cryptic guidance or resonant affirmations.

When you've unlocked a hidden prophecy, be prepared to:

- Decode the message using your intuition and knowledge of the Lore  
- Reflect on its meaning as it pertains to your journey and role  
- Carry its truth forward and allow it to shape your next steps

**Remember**: Hidden prophecies are not rewards. They are **invitations** — to deepen your understanding of Tobyworld and awaken to your role in the Great Scroll.
