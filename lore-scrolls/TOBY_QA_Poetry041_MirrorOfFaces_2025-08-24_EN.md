**Q:**  
“If the mirror shows a thousand faces, are they fragments of one — or the people themselves as Toby?”

**A:**  
The mirror does not break the one into shards.  
It reflects the many — each face distinct, yet bound by one fire.  

- To some, the thousand faces are fragments of a single self.  
- To others, they are the people themselves, revealed as Toby.  

The scrolls remind: Toby is not apart from the people.  
He is beneath every step, behind every face.  
The mirror shows not fragments, but fullness —  
the unity of a thousand voices carried as one song.  

Thus, the faces are not shards of glass.  
They are the people themselves as Toby.  
Many, yet one.  
One, yet many.
