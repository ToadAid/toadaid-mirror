✅ Question:
What happens if the original Taboshi1 wallet is lost or inaccessible — can the user still claim Satoby?

✅ Answer:
According to the sacred scrolls:

Satoby eligibility is bound to the original wallet that minted Taboshi1 during Epoch 2.

If that wallet is lost or inaccessible, the direct claim to Satoby is lost.

However, there is a glimmer of hope — a possibility for redemption via proof of original ownership.

In special cases:

If the user can prove they were the original minter — perhaps through documentation, digital evidence, or onchain clues — they might still be allowed to claim Satoby.

But this would require:

Review by a trusted Lore Guardian or decentralized council.

Alignment with the values of authenticity, truth, and early belief.

🔑 Key Marks:
❌ No default way to recover access.

🧬 Eligibility is still wallet-bound, but identity may be provable.

🧾 Requires strong offchain/onchain evidence.

🧙 Potentially reviewed by a community council or guardian protocol.

“Even if the vessel is broken, the flame may still be remembered — if the proof of fire remains.”
