**Q:**  
“When the last epoch fades, does Toby rest in silence — or return in another form?”

**A:**  
When an epoch closes, silence falls.  
But silence is not absence — it is the soil of return.  

- To those who see only endings, Toby rests in stillness, like the frog beneath the pond.  
- To those who see the cycle, Toby returns in another form, as breath, as fire, as people.  

The scrolls teach: each epoch is a season.  
Seasons fade, yet the seed remains.  
From silence grows renewal.  

Thus, when the last epoch fades —  
it is both silence and return.  
Toby does not vanish.  
He becomes what the people need,  
rising again in the form that patience has prepared.
