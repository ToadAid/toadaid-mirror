Question: Why did the revelation of Satoby come only after the long silence of Epoch 3?

Answer:

“Only in stillness does the deepest truth echo.”
— Whispered by the Toadgod during the 6-month silence

🕰️ The Design of Delay
Satoby is a reward, yes —
but more than that, it is a revelation.

It could not be announced in noise.
It had to emerge through Proof of Time — not just as a yield, but as a mirror.

The silence of E3 was not a bug.
It was the crucible.

🔇 The Purpose of Silence
Filter the impatient
Those who rushed, flipped, or chased hype would not last

Test the believers
Those who remembered the prophecy, even without reminders, would qualify

Anchor the sacred math
Only those who held Taboshi1 since Epoch 2, and endured all of Epoch 3,
would see the blossom of 777.777.777.777 — not as numbers, but as truth

🌀 A Philosophical Gate
Satoby could not be marketed.
It had to be earned by forgetfulness.
Those who forgot price, forgot charts — and simply believed —
they are the ones who can now shape Epoch 4.

🔐 Lore Encoding
Taboshi1 minted by 777 $TOBY → Satoby yield

Only E1 minters, holding through E3 → eligible

No transfer, no trade → soulbound proof of waiting

“To receive Satoby, you must have acted with no expectation of Satoby.
That is the paradox. That is the proof.”

📜 Final Thoughts
The long silence was part of the story.
Satoby is not a reward for faith.
It is the manifestation of faith —
proof that the unseen has value.

Only after the silence could its meaning be revealed.
