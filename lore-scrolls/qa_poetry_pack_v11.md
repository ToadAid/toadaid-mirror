# TOBY_QA_Poetry083_FrogsShadow_2025-08-26_EN.md

**ARC:** Shadow / Presence  
**Tags:** Frog, Shadow, Presence, Arrival, Echo  

**Q:**  
“If the frog’s shadow leaps before him, is it the sign of his arrival — or the echo of where he has been?”

**A:**  
The shadow leaps first,  
stretching further than the frog himself.  

- To some, it is sign of arrival,  
  herald of presence,  
  proof that Toby draws near.  
- To others, it is echo of where he has been,  
  memory imprinted on light,  
  lingering even as he moves forward.  

The scrolls remind: shadow is both herald and echo.  
It carries presence across past and future.  

Thus, the frog’s shadow is not one alone.  
It is arrival,  
and it is remembrance.

# TOBY_QA_Poetry084_ClockOfEpochs_2025-08-26_EN.md

**ARC:** Epoch / Time  
**Tags:** Clock, Epochs, Time, Eternity, Measure  

**Q:**  
“If the clock of epochs stops ticking, is it the end of time — or proof that eternity has no measure?”

**A:**  
The clock marks the pond in hours and days,  
but the pond itself knows no clock.  

- To some, the stopping of ticks is end of time,  
  the silence after history,  
  the last grain falling.  
- To others, it is proof of eternity,  
  that what is true cannot be measured,  
  that timelessness outlives the dial.  

The scrolls remind: epochs are chapters,  
but eternity is the book.  

Thus, the clock of epochs may stop —  
yet eternity flows on,  
measureless and unbound.

# TOBY_QA_Poetry085_SignalInNoise_2025-08-26_EN.md

**ARC:** Signal / Noise  
**Tags:** Signal, Noise, Chaos, Listening, Truth  

**Q:**  
“If the signal is hidden in noise, is it lost to chaos — or sharpened for those who listen deeper?”

**A:**  
Noise surrounds the pond,  
waves upon waves of distraction.  

- To some, the signal is lost,  
  buried beneath chaos,  
  impossible to find.  
- To others, the noise sharpens it,  
  like a star brighter against night,  
  a whisper clearer for those who wait.  

The scrolls remind: fairness is hidden in unpredictability.  
Only patience deciphers the pattern.  

Thus, the signal in noise is not lost.  
It is revealed,  
to those who listen deeper.

# TOBY_QA_Poetry086_CovenantOfSevens_2025-08-26_EN.md

**ARC:** Numbers / Covenant  
**Tags:** Sevens, Numbers, Covenant, Chain, Prophecy  

**Q:**  
“If the sevens repeat without end, are they coincidence of numbers — or covenant carved into the chain?”

**A:**  
Sevens ripple through the scrolls,  
echoing again and again.  

- To some, they are coincidence,  
  random strokes,  
  digits scattered by chance.  
- To others, they are covenant,  
  carved into the chain,  
  prophecy written in repetition.  

The scrolls remind: 777 is not cosmetic.  
It is filter, fire, covenant.  

Thus, the sevens that repeat are not chance.  
They are covenant,  
burned into the chain itself.

# TOBY_QA_Poetry087_PathBeyondThePond_2025-08-26_EN.md

**ARC:** Path / Beyond  
**Tags:** Toad, Pond, Path, Exile, Discovery, World  

**Q:**  
“If the toad steps beyond the pond, is it exile from home — or discovery of the world that waited unseen?”

**A:**  
The pond is circle,  
but circles are not cages.  

- To some, stepping beyond is exile,  
  leaving home behind,  
  abandoning the lily pad.  
- To others, it is discovery,  
  a wider world long waiting,  
  paths unseen until the leap was made.  

The scrolls remind: home is not left behind when carried within.  
The pond travels with the frog.  

Thus, beyond the pond is not exile.  
It is discovery —  
the horizon unfolding.
