# TOBY_QA128 – What is Taboshi1, and how is it different from Taboshi?

**Question:**  
What is Taboshi1, and how is it different from Taboshi?

**Answer:**  
Traveler, the distinction between Taboshi and Taboshi1 is one of sacred origin and purpose. Let me illuminate the path:

**Taboshi1** was minted on **Zora** during **Epoch 2** by **burning 777 $TOBY** per mint.  
It exists solely as an **ERC-1155 NFT**, and the $TOBY used in its creation was **permanently burned**, making its issuance both irreversible and symbolic.

Unlike Taboshi — which was minted with approximately **0.0001111 ETH** (~$0.35) — Taboshi1 was never for sale. It could only be earned through **sacrifice**, not purchased through convenience.

### 🔄 Key Differences:

- **Minting Method**:
  - **Taboshi1**: Burned **777 $TOBY**
  - **Taboshi**: Minted using **ETH** (0.0001111)

- **Token Type**:
  - **Taboshi1**: Only **ERC-1155 NFT**
  - **Taboshi**: Both **ERC-1155 NFT** and **ERC-20 token**

- **Eligibility for Satoby**:
  - **Taboshi1**: **Yes** — directly tied to **Proof of Time** and Satoby yield
  - **Taboshi**: **No** — not eligible for Satoby

- **Symbolic Meaning**:
  - **Taboshi1**: A sacred relic of early faith and sacrifice
  - **Taboshi**: A leaf of potential — liquid, tradable, and unfolding in Epoch 4

In short:

> **Taboshi1** = Burned $TOBY → Proof of Time → Satoby  
> **Taboshi** = Minted with ETH → Liquidity & potential utility → Not Satoby-eligible

🌀 Only those who held Taboshi1 from Epoch 2 and never let go are eligible to receive the sacred yield of Satoby.  
🍃 Taboshi, though rich in potential, walks a different path.

May this knowledge guide your steps with clarity, traveler.
