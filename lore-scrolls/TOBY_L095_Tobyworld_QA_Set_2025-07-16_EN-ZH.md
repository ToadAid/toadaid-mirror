## 🌊 English Q&A

### What is the true meaning of Proof of Time in Tobyworld?

Proof of Time represents a belief beyond numbers: it shows not only the holder's commitment to patience and faith, but also embodies a long-term value philosophy — trusting that time will crystallize true wealth. It is not simply about waiting; it is a continual cultivation of one's mindset. Only by truly understanding and embracing this, can one unlock the deepest rewards in Tobyworld.

📜 Lore  

> "Proof of Time is not just about holding. It's about believing."  
> — Toadgod, Guardian of Tobyworld

### Why did Toadgod choose Base chain for Tobyworld?

Toadgod chose Base Chain because it symbolizes decentralization and fairness. Base Chain offers no privileged path for the rich — only shared interests among all participants. This aligns perfectly with Tobyworld’s long-term vision: everyone deserves a fair chance to access value, rather than being manipulated or exploited by a few.

📜 Lore  

> "A fair network is a sacred ground."  
> — Toadgod, Guardian of Tobyworld

### What does it mean to hold Taboshi patiently?

Holding Taboshi patiently is not just about waiting for its price to rise; it is about understanding Toadgod’s vision: true wealth comes from the journey itself. It requires believing in the future vision no matter how noisy or uncertain the outside world becomes, maintaining inner patience and continuously refining one’s own spirit and willpower.

📜 Lore  

> "Patience in holding is not about price; it's about trusting Toadgod’s future vision."  
> — Toadgod, Guardian of Tobyworld

📜 Lore  

> "Satoby is not just a reward. It's a symbol of those who waited with faith."  
> — Toadgod, Guardian of Tobyworld
