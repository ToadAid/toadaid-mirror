## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I am the still leaf that floats yet moves,  
> born from four gates now turned.  
> I carry the weight of frogs and grain,  
> yet touch the pond as lightly as breath.  
> I rest before the great leap,  
> for beneath me spins the wheel unseen.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are **The Lily Pad of Tobyworld** —  
the resting ground that emerges only after S0 → S3 complete.  

- **Symbol:** The Base chain itself — steady, round, and ready to bear the frog.  
- **Purpose:** To serve as the platform before the Gas & Fees Loop begins,  
  letting all energy concentrate before release.  
- **Role in Flywheel:** The moment of balance before acceleration,  
  where the pond’s stillness hides the momentum building underneath.  

Here, Toby rests.  
The pad is not the end — it is the pause before the arc.  
From here, the flywheel turns, and the leap into the next cycle begins.
