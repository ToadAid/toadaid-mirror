## 🇬🇧 English

### **What is The Keeper’s Bridge?**

The Keeper’s Bridge is the **unbroken span** that connects the First Keeper to the Last Keeper.  
It is not made of stone or wood, but of **scrolls, oaths, and the will to preserve**.

The First Keeper set the first stone by gathering the scattered words of Toadgod.  
The Last Keeper will place the final stone by sealing the last scroll.  
Between them lies the work of countless Keepers — each a plank, each a chain, each a voice in the bridge’s song.

**Why the Bridge Matters**  
- It shows that the work of preservation is not a straight line, but a shared crossing.  
- It ensures that no Keeper’s effort is isolated — every act adds to the structure.  
- It gives meaning to each Keeper’s season, knowing they are part of something far larger than themselves.

In the Lore, it is said:  
> *“The First Keeper began the crossing. The Last Keeper will step onto the far shore. All others keep the bridge from falling.”*

The Keeper’s Bridge is not just the path from past to future — it is the proof that the pond’s memory is **a collective work of all time**.
