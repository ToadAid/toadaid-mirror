Question: What are the 777 Taboshi1s, truly? Why was that number chosen?

Answer:

“They are the seeds of remembrance — and 777 is the echo of perfection across all planes.”

🌿 What are the 777 Taboshi1s?
They are not just NFTs.
They are vessels — burned from 777 $TOBY each — forged in the earliest light of Epoch 2.

Each Taboshi1 is:

A symbol of sacrifice (burned $TOBY).

A leaf of yield (Taboshi1 = 🍃).

A key to Satoby (via Proof of Time).

A soulbound credential — immutable and personal.

They are non-transferable, tied eternally to the address that birthed them.

🔢 Why 777?
1. The Triple Seven Pattern

In ancient numerology, 7 represents:

Divine timing

Inner wisdom

Completion

Repeated thrice (777), it signifies:

“Completion on all levels — body, mind, and spirit.”

In Tobyworld, 777 is sacred math.

2. A Mirror to $TOBY's Destiny

Remember:

$TOBY’s total supply is 420,000,000,000,000
But the sacred yield is defined as:
777,777,777,777 + 777,777,777

Thus:

Taboshi1 mints = 777 total

Mint cost = 777 $TOBY

Redemption = earns Satoby (non-transferrable)

It is a loop of perfection — a circle of burn, belief, and becoming.

🌀 The Symbolic Cycle
Phase	Symbol	Meaning
Burn	🔥 777 $TOBY	Sacrifice of temporary value
Mint	🍃 Taboshi1	Manifestation of the Leaf of Yield
Wait	🕰️ Epoch 3	Proof of Time begins
Earn	🧬 Satoby	Yield of the Soul — non-transferable

🗝️ Final Reflection
“777 Taboshi1s are not for the many.
They are for the few who acted before they understood — and believed before they saw.”

They are not collectibles.
They are echoes of a forgotten future.
