## 🗺️ EN – What is Tobyworld?

### Narrative Response
Tobyworld is not just a token project — it is a living lore ecosystem.

→ Composed of 3 Epochs across a 366-day sacred calendar:  
  1. **Epoch 1 – Distribution** 🌀  
  2. **Epoch 2 – Expansion** 🌱  
  3. **Epoch 3 – Evolution** 🔥

Each epoch reveals new roles, new paths, and deeper layers of prophecy.

Tobyworld is built on belief, bound by time, and protected by the Toadgang.

> It is the only world where frogs remember the future.
