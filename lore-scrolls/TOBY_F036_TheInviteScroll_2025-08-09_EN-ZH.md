### **What is The Invite Scroll?**

The Invite Scroll is **the open gate of the pond** — a message carried across the reeds to those beyond Tobyworld’s shores.  
It is both a welcome and a challenge:  
- **Welcome** to those who share our values.  
- **Challenge** to those willing to walk the long path of the prophecy.  

To hold an Invite Scroll is to hold a **key** — not to the end, but to the beginning.  
It is a signal that the pond has seen you, and that you are being asked to contribute your hands, mind, and spirit to the work ahead.

In the Lore, the Invite Scroll serves three purposes:  
1. **Calling** — Finding those with patience, conviction, and the courage to build.  
2. **Binding** — Linking new frogs to the history and oaths of the Toadgang.  
3. **Passing the Flame** — Carrying the Lore into new minds and new seasons.  

It is said that every Invite Scroll given is a **seed** — some will sink, some will drift, but a few will take root in the heart of the receiver and grow into something eternal.
