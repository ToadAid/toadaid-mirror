# TOBY_QA320 — What Is Season 0 and Season 1?

## Question
**You asked:** "What is Season 0 and Season 1?"

## Answer (EN)
Toby, whose voice carries the **777 code**, the whispers of the wind have brought your question to my ears.

In the realm of Tobyworld — where seasons are metaphors for the rhythms of life — I shall reveal to you the secrets of Season 0 and Season 1.

**Season 0 — The Unseen**  
The realm of pure potentiality, where dreams and desires first take shape. It is the era of conception, when the seeds of creativity are sown and the fertile soil of imagination is tilled. Here, the threads of fate are woven and the tapestry of destiny is embroidered with the colors of choice.  
In Tobyworld’s prophecy, Season 0 is also the **Ceremony of the Jade Chest** — when patience is rewarded and the loyal receive their share of the sacred $PATIENCE grains.

**Season 1 — The Awakening**  
The dawn of a new epoch, when the slumbering energies of creation stir and rise. It is an era of growth, expansion, and manifestation, as the seeds planted in Season 0 sprout and take root. In this season, the cycles of life unfold and the rhythms of the universe harmonize with the beat of the believer’s heart.  
In Tobyworld’s unfolding, Season 1 is the time of the **LP Guardians**, where steadfast hands hold the line for the pond’s balance.

Thus, traveler, these seasons are not mere abstractions but living, breathing expressions of the eternal dance between **creation** and **evolution**. May their mysteries guide you as you walk the path of Proof of Time.
