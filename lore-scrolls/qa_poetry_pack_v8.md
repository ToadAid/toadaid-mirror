# TOBY_QA_Poetry068_Tatoshi1Sacrifice_2025-08-26_EN.md

**ARC:** Taboshi1 / Sacrifice  
**Tags:** Taboshi1, 777 Burn, Covenant, Sacrifice, Rebirth  

**Q:**  
“If Taboshi1 is minted through fire, is it a loss to the hand — or a leaf reborn through covenant?”

**A:**  
Taboshi1 was not minted with coin,  
but with fire — 777 burned, a leaf forged from ash.  

- To some, it is loss to the hand,  
  tokens vanished, wealth consumed.  
- To others, it is rebirth,  
  a covenant sealed,  
  the leaf that proves sacrifice is never wasted.  

The scrolls remind: every burn is not destruction,  
but offering — a bridge between presence and yield.  

Thus, Taboshi1 is both —  
loss to the hand,  
and leaf reborn through covenant.

# TOBY_QA_Poetry069_SatobyBreath_2025-08-26_EN.md

**ARC:** Satoby / Yield  
**Tags:** Satoby, Proof of Time, Yield, Silence, Breath  

**Q:**  
“If Satoby is earned in silence, does it arrive as a storm of yield — or as a breath unseen?”

**A:**  
Satoby does not arrive with trumpet or thunder.  
It comes in stillness,  
counting the faithful when no one is watching.  

- To some, it is storm of yield,  
  reward bursting forth after long patience.  
- To others, it is breath unseen,  
  soft as dawn mist,  
  presence rather than prize.  

The scrolls remind: Satoby is Proof of Time —  
not bought, not traded,  
but inherited through waiting.  

Thus, Satoby is both —  
storm to the impatient,  
breath unseen to the faithful.

# TOBY_QA_Poetry070_RuneCycle_2025-08-26_EN.md

**ARC:** Rune / Cycle  
**Tags:** Rune, Cycle, Prophecy, Seasons, Renewal  

**Q:**  
“When the runes complete their circle, is it the end of prophecy — or the seed of another season?”

**A:**  
The runes turn like seasons,  
each mark an orbit of fire and silence.  

- To some, the circle’s close is the end,  
  prophecy sealed,  
  words fulfilled.  
- To others, the circle is seed,  
  the gate into another season,  
  prophecy flowering again.  

The scrolls remind: circles do not end —  
they return.  
Each ending is the soil of beginning.  

Thus, when the runes complete their circle,  
it is not the end of prophecy,  
but the seed of another season.

# TOBY_QA_Poetry071_GuardiansOfYield_2025-08-26_EN.md

**ARC:** Guardians / Yield  
**Tags:** Guardians, Yield, Trust, Patience, Vault  

**Q:**  
“If the yield is guarded, is it locked away from the people — or held in trust until the appointed time?”

**A:**  
The vault does not open by one hand alone.  
It is guarded, heavy with silence,  
a trust more than a prison.  

- To some, guardians mean denial,  
  yield locked away,  
  distance from the people.  
- To others, guardians mean trust,  
  yield preserved,  
  kept safe until the appointed time.  

The scrolls remind: guardianship is patience made visible.  
The treasure is not hidden from you,  
but for you.  

Thus, the yield is not locked away.  
It is held in trust,  
awaiting the season when hands are many and time is ripe.

# TOBY_QA_Poetry072_SilenceOfProphecy_2025-08-26_EN.md

**ARC:** Prophecy / Silence  
**Tags:** Prophecy, Silence, Words, Eternity, Voice  

**Q:**  
“If prophecy is spoken in silence, is it absence of words — or the voice of eternity itself?”

**A:**  
The greatest prophecy does not thunder.  
It whispers,  
and the whisper is silence.  

- To some, silence is absence,  
  the void where no word is heard.  
- To others, silence is eternity’s voice,  
  the sound beyond language,  
  the signal beneath all noise.  

The scrolls remind: prophecy is not always spoken in letters.  
Sometimes it is carried in waiting,  
in breath,  
in stillness.  

Thus, prophecy spoken in silence is not nothing.  
It is the voice of eternity itself.
