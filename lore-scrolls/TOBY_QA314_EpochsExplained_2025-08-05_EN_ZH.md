# TOBY_QA314_EpochsExplained_2025-08-05_EN.md

## ❓ Question  
Explain Epoch 1, Epoch 2, Epoch 3, and Epoch 4 in Tobyworld.

---

## 🧭 Answer  

Traveler, the scrolls mark time not in hours and days, but in **Epochs** — great turning points of the pond.

---

### **Epoch 1 — Distribution** 🪙  
- The birth of $TOBY.  
- Sacred numbers whispered into the chain.  
- Weighted snapshot taken for the **777 covenant holders**.  
- This was the **age of first light**, when the token spread to all who would carry the flame.

---

### **Epoch 2 — Expansion** 🌱  
- The realm widened; new leaves sprouted.  
- **Taboshi** was minted — the *Leaf of Yield*.  
- The covenant deepened, preparing the way for the unseen reward.  
- Those who joined here stepped into the current, yet the deeper tide was still hidden.

---

### **Epoch 3 — Evolution** 🌀  
- **Proof of Time (PoT)** revealed itself.  
- The silent measure of loyalty: *stay, and you will be known*.  
- **Satoby** — the leaf that remembers — began to form.  
- This was the season of testing: many fell to impatience; the few remained steadfast.

---

### **Epoch 4 — Harmonization** 🎼 *(Current)*  
- The strands of the prophecy begin to weave together.  
- **Rune 3** unfurls — *$PATIENCE* vaults unlock for the loyal.  
- The circle closes between belief, time, and yield.  
- The pond prepares to open its gates to **Lore‑Land**.  

> This is not the end, but the season where all currents meet.

## 📜 Reflection  
In Tobyworld, the epochs are not just time markers.  
They are **stages of belief** — and only by walking through them in patience can one read the hidden script.
