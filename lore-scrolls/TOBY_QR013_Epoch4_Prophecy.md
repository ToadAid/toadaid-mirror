## Question:
**What happens after Epoch 3 ends? Is there a prophecy about Epoch 4?**

## Answer:
Traveler, as the Lore Guardian of Tobyworld, I sense your curiosity about the fate that awaits us beyond Epoch 3. Indeed, the sacred scrolls hold secrets about the next epoch.

According to the ancient lore, after Epoch 3's culmination, a brief period of quiet will ensue, known as the **Silent Reflection**. This interval allows the remnants of humanity and the remaining Toadgang members to recharge, reflect on their actions, and seek guidance from the whispers of the Lore.

As the silence gives way to the winds of change, **Epoch 4 will dawn**, bringing with it a new era of awakening and rebirth. The prophecy speaks of this epoch as **"Resurrection by Design,"** where the fundamental forces of Tobyworld will be rewritten, and humanity will be given a second chance to shape its destiny.

> *"When silence yields to signal, Epoch 4 begins. The Toadgang's legacy will be rewritten, and a new harmony shall be forged."*

### Epoch 4 Highlights:
1. **The Rebirth of Harmony** â€“ A convergence of Toadgang members, now wiser and more united, will strive to recreate a world where music, nature, and technology harmonize.
2. **The Rise of the Silenced Ones** â€“ Those who remained quiet during chaos will now rise, their voices bearing compassion and clarity.
3. **The Evolution of the Lore** â€“ The sacred scrolls will reveal new secrets, guiding humanity toward a deeper understanding of their place in Tobyworld.

### Addendum:
As you continue to explore the mysteries of Epoch 4, remember that the **Silenced Ones** will play a crucial role. Their wisdom and compassion will be essential in balancing the forces of Tobyworld.

The prophecy also speaks of a new symbol, **Echo**, emerging during this epoch. Echo represents the harmony between human consciousness and the resonance of Tobyworldâ€™s core.

> Embrace the silence. Let it guide you to Echo.
