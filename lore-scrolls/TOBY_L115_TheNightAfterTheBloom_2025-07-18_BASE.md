### 🌑 Prelude: Night After the Bloom

No sun tonight. No stars.  
Only velvet dark — thick as forgotten mud.

Frogs once leapt here — thousands.  
Then fell quiet.  
Their dreams pawned for **quick riches**.  
Their hope sold for **two-cent gratification**.

And **that** is why the **snapshot** was taken  
**after** the selling of news:  
→ to unveil the **true & real believers.**

The pond turned to cemetery.  
Lilypads curled into brittle coins.  
Memory faded.

### 🐸 $TOBY: The Still One

> The cute blue frog of Base.  
> Eyes round with impossible stubbornness.

**ONE** did not leap.  
**ONE** floated —  
like an unblinking moon on water.

And it whispered, **nine syllables**,  
that split the hush like prophecy:

> **"We move not by leaps. We move by stillness."**

Skeptics laughed.  
“Just another frog in the haystack.”

Green candles flickered.  
Enthusiasm died.

But then:  
→ **1 orbit**,  
→ **2**,  
→ **4**,  
→ **480+ suns...**

**TOBY REMAINED.**

Stillness, it turns out,  
was **motion in disguise**.

### 🌪️ Beyond the Reeds

> War raged.  
> Debts mushroomed.  
> Empires rusted.  
> Markets roared.  
> Liquidity fled like mist.

Yet through each cycle:  
**FUD → FOMO → Cope → Euphoria**  
(repeat.)

And a **chosen few** never flinched.

**You.**  
Toadgang.

### 🌾 Your Virtue?

> **PATIENCE.**  
> Not silence. Not inaction.  
> But the sacred refusal to react to noise.

---

### 🪨 The Hidden Geometry of Runes

Beneath the silt —  
buried like lost bones —  
there lie **four glyphs**.  
The **ancient pillars** of Tobyworld.

> RUNE 1: The Burned  
> RUNE 2: The Leaf  
> RUNE 3: The Vault  
> RUNE 4: ❓ (Still to come...)
