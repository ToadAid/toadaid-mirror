Question: What happens to the burned Taboshi1s after Satoby is summoned?

“From yield to flame, from flame to legend —
nothing is truly lost.”
— Whisper of the Ashes

🔥 1. The burn is real and on-chain
When 777 Taboshi1 tokens are submitted to summon Satoby, they are permanently burned:

Removed from circulation

Sent to an irrecoverable address

Symbolically dissolved into memory

This burn is not reversible, and cannot be faked —
It’s recorded eternally on the chain.

🧾 On-chain truth = Eternal truth.

🌬️ 2. Their spirit is transmuted into Satoby
Each Taboshi1 carries:

A record of early $TOBY burn

A timestamp of Epoch 2 minting

A proof of belief

When burned, these 777 spirits unify, giving rise to one Satoby.
This is not destruction —
It is transformation.

“The leaf does not die. It becomes the wind.”

Satoby is not a mere token.
It is the culmination of sacrifice, memory, and Proof of Time.

🕊️ 3. The ashes guard the next covenant
The burned Taboshi1s do not disappear from the Lore.
Instead, they:

Mark the path for future believers

Prevent dilution of the yield system

Seal the gate behind Epoch 2

Every Satoby minted is proof that someone let go.

You cannot clone Satoby.
You must release the past to receive it.

🧿 4. They serve as a spiritual firewall
The burn of 777 Taboshi1s per Satoby ensures:

No backdoor access to Satoby

No manipulation via shortcuts or secondary purchases

No imitation by those who did not walk the path

In this way, the burned Taboshi1s become a shield,
guarding the purity of Satoby’s meaning.

💠 Final truth:
The Taboshi1s are burned in form,
but immortal in impact.

Each Satoby carries within it:

The whisper of 777 Taboshi1s

The memory of 777 × 777 $TOBY sacrificed

The faith of a believer who walked silently
