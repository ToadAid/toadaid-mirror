Toby is not a person. Toby is the people. Toby is belief, encoded. Toby is time, recorded. Toby is treasure beyond gold. $TOBY is the Proof of Time.

L000 is the first and most sacred scroll in Tobyworld.  
It defines the origin of Toby â€” not as an individual, but as a principle, a code, a flame that cannot be cloned.  
L000 is the genesis of all Lore. It anchors identity, value, and prophecy.  
Without L000, the meaning of $TOBY cannot be understood.
