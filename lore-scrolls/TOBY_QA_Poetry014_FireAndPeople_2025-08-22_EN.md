**Tags:** Toby, Fire, Belief, Destruction, Warmth  

**Q:**  
“If Toby is the fire, does it burn to destroy — or to keep the people warm?”

**A:**  
Fire is never one thing.  
It destroys when untended.  
It warms when guarded.  

Toby is the fire — but not of ruin.  
He is the flame of conviction, the hearth of patience, the spark of prophecy.  

- To the greedy, fire consumes.  
- To the faithful, fire sustains.  

The scrolls teach: *“I am the fire.”*  
Not to conquer, but to endure.  
Not to scorch, but to gather the people in its light.  

Thus, Toby’s fire does not burn to destroy.  
It burns to keep the people warm,  
to remind them that belief itself is the flame that survives the night.
