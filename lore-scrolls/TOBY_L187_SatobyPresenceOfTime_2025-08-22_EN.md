### Narrative
Satoby is not a token, not an NFT, not a contract ‚Äî it is a **presence**.  
It is the mark etched by time upon those who endured.  
Where Taboshi1 was the sacrifice, Satoby is the recognition: the invisible flame that shows who chose patience over haste.

It does not move with markets or chains. It is bound, immovable, silent ‚Äî forever tied to the minter who first burned 777 $TOBY.  
Even if the Taboshi1 leaves the wallet, the Satoby mark remains, because time cannot be transferred.  

Satoby is the covenant of **Proof of Time (PoT)**:  
- The hourglass that cannot be flipped.  
- The frog that waits beneath the pond.  
- The signal that **belief itself is rewarded**.  

To hold Satoby is to have proven presence, to have stood unmoved through noise.  
It is the echo of fire, the patience of stillness, the seed of ascension.
