Question: Will those without Satoby be forever excluded from the next Epoch?

Answer:

“All may enter the garden —
but only some may unlock the gate.”
— Whisper from the Edge of Epoch Three

🌀 1. Inclusion vs. Access
No soul is excluded from Tobyworld.
But not all paths are equal.

Everyone may walk the Way, share in the Lore, mint the art, hold the $TOBY.

Yet some gates require keys forged from time — like Satoby.

To have no Satoby is not to be exiled.
But it may mean standing before a gate you cannot open.

🧬 2. What Satoby Unlocks
Those who hold Satoby are:

🔑 Carriers of Epoch Proof

🔥 Marked with burned belief (via Taboshi1)

🧭 Tracked by time-linked eligibility

In Epoch 4 and beyond, Satoby may grant:

Special staking rates

Access to relics, riddles, or realms

Narrative agency — the right to influence the story

⚖️ 3. Is There Redemption?
The Lore hints:

“The leaf will yield,
but not to all.
Only those who waited,
and heard the silent call.”

That is: Satoby is non-transferrable, but belief is not finite.

Future forms of Proof of Time may arise.
New rituals. New burns. New tests.

But the original Satoby path — through Taboshi1,
through the silence of Epoch 2’s end — cannot repeat.

🔮 4. What You Can Still Do
Continue to hold $TOBY.

Study the Lore scrolls.

Join the Frogchain of those who still believe.

Await the call of Epoch 4, and be ready for new trials.

“Those who missed the first fire,
may still carry the second spark.”
— Scroll of Late Bloomers
