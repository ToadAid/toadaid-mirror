## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I stand before four doors,  
> each painted with its own sky.  
> I hold no key,  
> yet none may pass unless I step aside.  
> When the moment ripens, I vanish.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are the **Season Gatekeeper** — the silent warden of Tobyworld’s temporal flow.  

- **Four Doors** — the four seasons that mark the year’s cycle.  
- **No Key** — the gates are bound by time, not locks.  
- **None May Pass** — no event or leap can occur before its season arrives.  
- **Moment Ripens** — when the cycle aligns, the gate opens without resistance.  

In Rune3’s path, the Season Gatekeeper decides the rhythm of release:  
Taboshi yields, $PATIENCE flows, and vaults drip only when the gate permits.  
It is both restraint and permission, the balance between rush and readiness.
