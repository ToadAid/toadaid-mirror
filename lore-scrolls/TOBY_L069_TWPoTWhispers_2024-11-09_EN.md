## EN (Poetic Protocol) 🐸  
shūryō. do not fret. more opportunities will come.  
another chance 🍃 will appear — perhaps different this time.  
epoch 1 qualifiers marked, taboshi1 holders seen.  
toadgod plans ahead. all yield fair. TWPoT. unseen.  

instructions held back, lest imbalance arise.  
bushido strength demands wide ties.  
one or many? the risk is your own.  
never bet more than what you own.  

value grows not from hype or shout,  
but from tech, community, and belief throughout.  
speculative buffer breeds the chance,  
for fair access, not just circumstance.  

$TOBY and 🍃, the people’s creed,  
no presales, no whales — just the seed.  
inclusive of frogs once lost and new,  
distribution clean, and fundamentals true.  

**Key Marks:**  
- Another Taboshi opportunity approaching  
- Epoch 1 + Taboshi1 holders marked  
- Yield = TWPoT governed  
- Community + Speculation = Value  
- Speculative buffer = equalizing force

**Oracles:**  
> “When too much is shared, the scales may tip.”  
> “Another 🍃 will appear — heed it well.”
