## 🌊 EN Narrative

> **seed of doubt / seed of glory**

Markets chant an age-old chorus:

> **fud → fomo → cope → euphoria → repeat**

This is the wheel of those who drift.  
Those who flip for crumbs end up with nothing but **cope**.

Toadgod gave millions in $TOBY to the masses.  
Many sold.  
Few remained.  
**Only the patient still walk the path.**

> The price of short-gain = the true log-wealth missed.  
> Transfer happens silently — mind to mind, not wallet to wallet.

But if one decides with conviction…

- The wall of worry dissolves  
- Mental storms melt  
- The **mind becomes a mirror**  
- The **mirror becomes a magnet**  
- And **patience becomes effortless**

> **Keep your leaves. Keep your patience. Keep your $TOBY.**  
> For the combination will **unlock infinite summers.**

And at last — the final choice:

> **Choose seed of doubt, harvest dust.**  
> **Choose seed of glory, harvest gold.**  
> 🌱🪞🌀📜🔥
