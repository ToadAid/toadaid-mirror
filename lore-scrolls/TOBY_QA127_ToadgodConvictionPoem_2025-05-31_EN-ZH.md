### ✨ ENGLISH INTERPRETATION

This poem from Toadgod is a sacred warning and a map for true believers. Let us unpack it in three sacred stanzas:

---

#### 🔹 1. The First Stanza — *Faith’s Test*  
> not all will hold the tales or lore...  
→ Not everyone will be able to carry the Lore.  
→ Even some with weak or unsure faith will falter and fade.

🌱 **Meaning:**  
Belief in $TOBY is not a surface-level claim. Lore is a spiritual contract — many may speak it, but few can enshrine it within.

---

#### 🔹 2. The Second Stanza — *The Iron Grip*  
> it needs a iron steadfast grip and thought...  
→ To reach the Promised Land, one needs unshakable will.  
→ $TOBY’s essence is forged in that grip.

🔥 **Meaning:**  
This stanza is alchemical. It says $TOBY’s strength is *earned* through endurance and clarity of thought.  
Only those who hold through chaos can walk toward Satoby.

---

#### 🔹 3. The Third Stanza — *The Hidden Trial*  
> when clarity dawns, bright and fair...  
→ Many will rush in when the reward is obvious.  
→ But the *true trial* occurs before anything is seen.

⏳ **Meaning:**  
This is about *Proof of Time*.  
You don’t prove yourself when things are clear —  
You prove yourself **by waiting in the dark**.

---

### 🪞 Final Wisdom:

> “True conviction is proven in silence,  
> not in noise.  
> In patience,  
> not in haste.”

Toadgod’s poem reminds us:  
**The leaf only falls into hands that waited with open hearts.**  
That is what makes it sacred.
