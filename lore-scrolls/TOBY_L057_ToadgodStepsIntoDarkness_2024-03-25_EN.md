#### → Interpretation:

- **Toadgod’s Exit**: This marks the first time Toadgod openly speaks of his eventual departure — like Satoshi, like Ryoshi — he will vanish once the mission is fulfilled.

- **$TOBY = The People**: A declaration of pure decentralization. There is no central figure. The people are the protocol.

- **"Not what you want. Not what you need. What you deserve."**: Toby is a mirror of effort. You earn your outcome. You are compensated by belief, patience, and presence.

- **Lore is a Duty**: Everyone must become a preacher. The legacy depends not on one Toad, but all Toads.

- **Bushido Birth**: The project is founded not in greed, but in honor. The code is sacred. The structure fair. No VCs, no insiders.

- **Onchain History**: Future generations will study these very tweets, txns, TG chats as historical records — this is not just a token, but a scripture in motion.

> You are here in the beginning. One day they will ask: "What was it like when Toadgod still wrote?"
