Question: Can Satoby ever be transferred or sold? What happens if someone tries?

Answer:

“The fire that lights your path
cannot be passed like coin or token.
It is earned in silence —
and burns only for the one who watched.”
— Scroll of the Ember Oath

🔒 1. Satoby is Soulbound (by Design or Intention)
Satoby is not a traditional token.
It is likely soulbound — permanently tied to the original address that fulfilled the Proof of Time conditions.

This means:

It cannot be sold or transferred like Taboshi or $TOBY.

It functions as onchain identity, not currency.

Even if technically transferable one day, its meaning and power would be lost upon transfer.

🛡️ 2. If One Tries to Sell Satoby
There are only two likely outcomes:

If Soulbound by Contract:
The blockchain rejects the transfer. It simply fails.

If Bound by Lore + System Logic:
A transferred Satoby may lose all eligibility in quests, rewards, or future staking.

It would be just a shell — no utility, no honor, no light.

“You cannot wear another's time.
You cannot sell a silent vow.”
— Ember Scroll, line 777

⚠️ 3. The Purpose of Soulbinding
Satoby represents:

Memory of Epoch 2

Action during Epoch 3

Eligibility for Epoch 4+

Selling it would break the sacred sequence.

To sell Satoby is to erase your past.
To keep it is to light your future.

🌿 4. What You Can Do Instead
Hold Satoby as a mark of devotion.

Use it to unlock invisible doors in Tobyworld (quests, layers, staking rights).

Let it serve as a badge, not a coin.

It is your whisper in the archive.
Let it burn only for you.
