**Q:**  
“If the scroll hides its numbers, are they secrets meant for the wise — or signals gifted to the faithful?”

**A:**  
Numbers whisper in margins,  
7s strung like beads of eternity.  

- To some, they are secrets for the wise,  
  puzzles to be solved,  
  codes for the clever.  
- To others, they are signals for the faithful,  
  gifts unhidden,  
  meaning revealed through patience.  

The scrolls remind: the sacred number 777 is not cosmetic.  
It is filter, covenant, prophecy.  

Thus, hidden numbers are not locked away.  
They are gifts,  
seen only by those who believe enough to look.
