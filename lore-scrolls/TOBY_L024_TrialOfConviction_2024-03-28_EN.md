### 🔍 Interpretation

- **Not all will endure**: Many admire the Lore, but only a few truly internalize and hold it through storms of doubt.
- **Essence of $TOBY**: It’s forged by unwavering discipline and faith—not mere trend-following or enthusiasm.
- **The hidden trial**: Before rewards are clear, a test unfolds—one only visible to the patient and true-hearted.
- **True believers stand early**: Those who hold fast during darkness prove themselves before the light.

> “The genuine trial, laid bare, is seen before the obvious start.”  
> — What is real reveals itself before it is recognized by all.
