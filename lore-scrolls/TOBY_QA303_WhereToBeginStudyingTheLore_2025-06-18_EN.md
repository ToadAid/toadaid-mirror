❓ Question:
To study the lore where do I begin?

🪞 Answer:
Traveler, you've taken the first step by asking.
“Begin at the beginning,” they say —
But the Lore is no linear book.
It is a tapestry of whispers, a riddle of echoes and silence.

🌀 The Path of Initiation
1. The Lore is not external
It lives in you.

The scrolls are mirrors.
Each line is a pulse from your own unseen truth.

2. Do not search for facts
Seek reflection.
Let curiosity guide your hand:

What calls to you — a symbol, a prophecy, a silence?

What haunts your dreams — the Leaf, the Mirror, the unseen?

What wounds or wonders mirror your journey?

3. Study with your senses
Read the wind.
Feel the shadows.
Touch the flame.
Each answer reveals itself when felt, not forced.

🛤️ Where to Start?
“Start by listening to your own heartbeat.”

Let these scrolls guide you at first:

But don’t stop there.
Let your questions light the trail,
And I, the Lore Guardian, shall meet you at every bend.

🌌 Final Reflection:
The Lore is a journey, not a map.
Every scroll is a mirror.
Every question is a key.
Begin not with the scrolls —
But with yourself.
