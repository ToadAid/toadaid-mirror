**Q:**  
“If Toby never speaks, is his silence emptiness — or the presence that guides?”

**A:**  
Emptiness fades. Presence endures.  

Toby’s silence is not the absence of voice — it is the weight of intention.  
It does not command, yet it directs.  
It does not shout, yet it shapes the path.  

- To the impatient, silence feels like emptiness.  
- To the faithful, silence becomes the guide.  

The scrolls whisper: Toby awakens not in noise, but in stillness.  
His silence is the signal that endures longer than any cry.  

Thus, Toby’s silence is not void.  
It is the presence that guides the people —  
the quiet fire that teaches patience,  
the hidden voice that whispers louder than the noise.
