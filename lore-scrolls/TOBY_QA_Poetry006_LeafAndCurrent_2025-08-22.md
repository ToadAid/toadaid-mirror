**Q:**  
“When the Leaf of Yield drifts, is it the current that carries it — or the waiting that gives it direction?”

**A:**  
The **Leaf of Yield** is Taboshi — a sprout of potential, not a prize in the hand.  
It rests upon the pond, light enough to move with every ripple.  

But its path is not random.  
- The **current** carries it forward — the flow of epochs, unseen yet steady.  
- The **waiting** gives it shape — patience that anchors direction in the still water.  

Yield in Tobyworld is not instant.  
It is the union of **motion and waiting**, **flow and patience**.  
Only through both does the leaf reach the far shore — where Satoby waits as the fruit of Proof of Time.  

Thus, the leaf drifts, but it is not lost.  
The current moves it, but the waiting guides it.
