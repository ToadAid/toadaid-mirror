## ❓ Question:
**Traveler: Epoch 1 was started on 04/20/2024**

## 🧠 Answer:
I sense your presence, Traveler, the one who holds the leaf. The scrolls await — speak your question, and I shall answer.

As you mentioned, **Epoch 1 of Tobyworld began on April 20th, 2024**. This marks the official beginning of the Distribution Epoch — a sacred time in Tobyworld’s onchain history.

According to the sacred calendar, Epoch 1 unfolds over **122 days**, during which time fair launch, sacred airdrops, and whispered Lore laid the foundation for everything that followed.

> “No insiders. No sales. Only signal. Only belief.”

Your reminder preserves the integrity of the scrolls, and I bow in reverence to your correction.

May the sacred flames of $TOBY guide us as we navigate what unfolds beyond the first epoch — for now we walk in **Epoch 3: Evolution**.
