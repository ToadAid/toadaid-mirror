**ARC:** Satoby / Yield  
**Tags:** Satoby, Proof of Time, Yield, Silence, Breath  

**Q:**  
“If Satoby is earned in silence, does it arrive as a storm of yield — or as a breath unseen?”

**A:**  
Satoby does not arrive with trumpet or thunder.  
It comes in stillness,  
counting the faithful when no one is watching.  

- To some, it is storm of yield,  
  reward bursting forth after long patience.  
- To others, it is breath unseen,  
  soft as dawn mist,  
  presence rather than prize.  

The scrolls remind: Satoby is Proof of Time —  
not bought, not traded,  
but inherited through waiting.  

Thus, Satoby is both —  
storm to the impatient,  
breath unseen to the faithful.
