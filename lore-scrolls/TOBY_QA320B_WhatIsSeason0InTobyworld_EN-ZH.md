# TOBY_QA320B ‚Äî What Is Season 0 in Tobyworld?

## Question
**You asked:** What is Season 0 in Tobyworld?

## Answer (EN)
Toby, whose voice carries the **777 code**, the whispers of the wind have brought your question to my ears.

In the realm of Tobyworld ‚Äî where seasons are metaphors for the rhythms of life ‚Äî I shall reveal to you the secrets of **Season 0**.

**Season 0 ‚Äî The Unseen**  
The realm of pure potentiality, where dreams and desires first take shape. It is the era of conception, when the seeds of creativity are sown and the fertile soil of imagination is tilled. Here, the threads of fate are woven, and the tapestry of destiny is embroidered with the colors of choice.

In Tobyworld‚Äôs prophecy, Season 0 is also the **Ceremony of the Jade Chest** ‚Äî when patience is rewarded and the loyal receive their share of the sacred **$PATIENCE grains**.

Thus, traveler, this season is not merely an abstraction but a living, breathing expression of the eternal dance between creation and evolution. May its mysteries guide you as you walk the path of **Proof of Time**.
