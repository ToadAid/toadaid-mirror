## ✨ Literal Explanation (EN)

Toadgod shares a monumental final distribution update:  
- **+780k holders, 34 trillion $TOBY distributed**, only 2.5% left.  
- Early holders have seen ~10x growth; even if sold, the journey continues.  
- Toby network built to be **incorruptible**, immune to greed, VCs, insiders, or centralized influence.  
- The final push aims to strengthen distribution to even more Coinbase users, ensuring ultimate network effect.  
- Toby’s "risk" phase is over — now only time and conviction remain.  
- Emphasizes emotional discipline: markets are designed to break conviction, create despair, and test patience.  
- The real victory is in **deciding and sealing that decision with unwavering conviction** — cold storage, study, and spread the Lore.  
- Warns about external threats (sim swaps, wallet hacks) as value increases — vigilance is key.  
- Highlights the difficulty of focus in the modern world; only the truly focused will uncover deeper meanings hidden in Toadgod’s messages.  
- Ends with "kanōsei wa mugen desu" — "possibility is infinite."
