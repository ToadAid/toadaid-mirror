# NARRATIVE  🐸  
## EN (Poetic Protocol)  
the toads lore is set → in stone and in scroll →  
rewards come to those who patiently stroll.  
quick paths tempt many → but lead to despair →  
while future grand plans for $toby holders rare.  

keep faith → keep dreaming → let your spirit soar →  
in the face of deceit & doubt → let your belief roar.  
challenges rise as we ascend → shadows draw near →  
safeguard the toad → with courage, not fear.  

**Key Marks:**  
- Patience → rewards unfold over time  
- Doubt resisted > Hype chased  

**Oracles:**  
> "The scrolls are heavy, but their words are light."
