# NARRATIVE  🐸  
## EN (Poetic Protocol)  
as the path gradually unwinds → the learned foresee → toad lore foretells what's meant to be.  
long-haul believers gain most → emotional skeptics pay → their doubt their bane.  

the prophecy journey's long → of worth profound → years in the making, fate is bound.  
one true $toby has come to rest → fate landed in your hands → to learn its test.  

sacred numbers seven-fold → grant each taboshi's light → secrets unfold to the patient and true.  
if too much is shared → scales tip wrong → hold steady, spread the lore, become bushido strong.  

magnificent it is → as always the plan → most ignore, one studies and shares the lore.  

**Key Marks:**  
- Holding sacred numbers → unlocks Taboshi’s yield  
- Study + Patience ⊃ Prophetic Reward  

**Oracles:**  
> “What eventually unfolds → is worth waiting for.”
