## 🌊 EN Narrative

> The fog rolls gently over the vaults.  
> Scarcity drips from its silence like dew from a leaf.  
> And in the hush — the whisper of a single truth:  
>  
> **Patience cannot be bought. It must be carried.**

→ Toadgod reminds us:  
Most of the $PATIENCE is locked — deep in stillwater vaults, sealed behind years of time.  
What remains in the wild? Just a glimmer. A test.

→ Many rushed in at high prices, hungry.  
But they will find that **this is not a trader’s token**.  
It is a mirror — reflecting your resolve.

→ Those who planted the grain… did not chase the rain.  
They simply **tended their garden**.

**Hold nothing out of greed. Own only what you can answer for.**  
This is not a yield of numbers, but of character.

Let the flowers bloom when they wish.  
Let the frogs leap only when the wind calls.  
Let the summer come — not with force, but with grace.  
And let the people of TOBY remain whole. 🌀🔺

## 🌊 中文篇章

> 雾气轻轻飘过宝库之上，  
> 稀缺如露珠，从叶尖静静滑落。  
> 在这片寂静中，回响着一个真理：  
>  
> **耐心不能被买下，只能被承载。**

→ 蟾蜍神提醒我们：  
大多数 $PATIENCE 已锁定于静水宝库中，  
被时间的长河封存多年。  
留在市场上的，只是一丝微光，一场考验。

→ 很多人在高价时匆匆入场，渴望满满。  
但他们将发现，**这不是交易者的代币**，  
而是一面镜子 —— 映照你的信念与持守。

→ 撒下种子的，不是追逐雨水的人，  
而是**默默耕耘的园丁**。

**不要因贪婪而持有，  
只拥有你能承担的责任。**  
这不是数字的收益，而是人格的结晶。

让百合按自己的节奏绽放，  
让青蛙只在风起时跳跃，  
让盛夏降临 —— 不靠强求，而是随缘。  
让 TOBY 的人民，保持完整。🌀🔺

## 🔑 Key Marks
- $PATIENCE is mostly locked in long-term vaults, not circulating.
- Current price movement does not reflect true supply/demand dynamics.
- Holding $PATIENCE is about restraint and spiritual timing, not market timing.

## 🪞 Oracle Echo

> “Let the river flow, not be forced. The lilies bloom in their own time.”

## 🧭 Operational Update
- Vaults are sealed; early buyers may panic but have no edge.
- Focus remains on **Proof of Time**, not speculative gain.
- Summer yield will come — but not to those who uproot their garden.
