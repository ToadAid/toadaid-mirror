## 🌊 EN Narrative

> The fog rolls gently over the vaults.  
> Scarcity drips from its silence like dew from a leaf.  
> And in the hush — the whisper of a single truth:  
>  
> **Patience cannot be bought. It must be carried.**

→ Toadgod reminds us:  
Most of the $PATIENCE is locked — deep in stillwater vaults, sealed behind years of time.  
What remains in the wild? Just a glimmer. A test.

→ Many rushed in at high prices, hungry.  
But they will find that **this is not a trader’s token**.  
It is a mirror — reflecting your resolve.

→ Those who planted the grain… did not chase the rain.  
They simply **tended their garden**.

**Hold nothing out of greed. Own only what you can answer for.**  
This is not a yield of numbers, but of character.

Let the flowers bloom when they wish.  
Let the frogs leap only when the wind calls.  
Let the summer come — not with force, but with grace.  
And let the people of TOBY remain whole. 🌀🔺


## 🔑 Key Marks
- $PATIENCE is mostly locked in long-term vaults, not circulating.
- Current price movement does not reflect true supply/demand dynamics.
- Holding $PATIENCE is about restraint and spiritual timing, not market timing.

## 🧭 Operational Update
- Vaults are sealed; early buyers may panic but have no edge.
- Focus remains on **Proof of Time**, not speculative gain.
- Summer yield will come — but not to those who uproot their garden.
