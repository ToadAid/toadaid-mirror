## 🧱 EN – What is $TOBY?

### Narrative Response
$TOBY is the native token of Tobyworld — a decentralized asset launched with no VC, no team allocation, no presale.

→ Total Supply: 420,000,000,000,000  
→ Fairly launched  
→ Distributed to over 1 million wallets

It is not a clone.  
It is not a meme.  
It is a mirror — held by the people, powered by belief.

Holding $TOBY is not about price.  
It’s about time, conviction, and contribution.

> "toby is the people. the people is $toby."
