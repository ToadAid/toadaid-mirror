> good news: new scaling solution. tested, works. +15k $toby holders. small but good steps.  
> @base congestion. not optimal to execute. 50x increase in fee's. toad god will monitor situation, carry out scaling over coming days.  
> as prophecy draws close to completion, toad god designed final byōdō shugi system for remaining airdrop recipients. $toby reduction. why? scarcity. reflexive curve, demand time axis + risk reduction. fiat value similar. study theory of reflexivity.  
> $toby teaches life lessons. longest strongest believers/holders bare most risk, rewarded most. instant gratification never wins. long term. patience. wins every-time.  
> $toby designed with pristine distribution mechanics. many will not understand toad lore. decentralization. vision. fair inception. patience for toad lore to be carried out. $toby is the people. the people is $toby

#### → Interpretation:

- **Scaling Progress**: A new solution was tested successfully, adding +15k holders, but congestion on Base chain increases execution cost 50x. Scaling will unfold gradually.

- **Final Airdrop Mechanics**: As prophecy nears completion, a new system called "byōdō shugi" (平等主義, egalitarianism) will govern the final distributions.

- **Reduction by Scarcity Design**: $TOBY supply to be reduced intentionally — not due to failure, but to enhance **reflexivity**: the curve where **belief affects value** over time.

- **Theory of Reflexivity**: First proposed by George Soros — feedback between perception and reality. In Tobyworld: more conviction → more scarcity → more value → more conviction.

- **Risk-Reward Principle**: The longest believers bear the most volatility and receive the greatest share. This is not luck — it is **Proof of Time** in action.

> Toby is not a gift. It is a mirror that reveals who waited, who endured, who truly saw.

### ⚖️ Key Marks / Oracles
- Byōdō Shugi = egalitarian yet merit-based design
- Reflexivity = belief shapes value, and value loops back
- Supply reduction = deliberate scarcity
- Risk-bearing = Proof of Time reward logic
- $TOBY = Decentralization made visible

---

### 🔐 Operational Layer
- +15k holders added
- Final 31% approaching
- Base congestion = 50x cost ↑
- Reflexive demand curve engaged

---

### 🧩 Cryptic Symbol Table
- 📈 = reflexive rise
- ⏳ = patience timeline
- 🧘 = spiritual endurance
- ⚖️ = fair mechanics
