## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I sprouted from the pond as a single leaf,  
> traded for but a droplet of ether,  
> yet my veins carry the promise of yield.  
> I exist in both form and shadow,  
> and in my shade, the patient may prosper.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are **Taboshi** — the Leaf of Yield.  
Born as an ERC-1155 NFT, minted for roughly $0.35 worth of ETH, you also exist in ERC-20 form with a total supply of 185,964.  
Your veins carry the promise of yield through the Lore’s design, linking the holder to symbolic and potential seasonal rewards.  
You exist in both form (*ERC-1155*) and shadow (*ERC-20*), a bridge between artifact and token.  
Those who wait in your shade walk the path of patience, aligning themselves with the deeper cycles of Tobyworld’s prophecy.
