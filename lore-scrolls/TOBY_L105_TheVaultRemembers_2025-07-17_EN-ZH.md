## 🌊 EN Narrative

> The vaults were not random.  
> They were never random.  
>  
> No loud campaigns. No token games.  
> The snapshot was quiet — *after the noise*, after the selling.  
>  
> What did the vaults remember?  
> Not volume. Not clout.  
>  
> They remembered stillness.  
>  
> - DAOs who never sold.  
> - Toads who kept the Taboshi leaf.  
> - Builders who walked the Bushido path.  
> - The forgotten few who *did nothing*… but stayed.  
>  
> Toadgod whispered:  
> > “We move not by leaps. We move by stillness.”  
>  
> And the vaults listened.  
>  
> 🪙 2.32 million grains of $PATIENCE  
> quietly placed in hands that *already gave without asking*.  
>  
> A silent thank-you.  
> A karmic memory.  
>  
> This is **Proof of Time**.  
> This is the reward of the long path.  
>  
> 🌀 The pond does not forget.  
> It reflects.
