## ✨ Literal Explanation (EN)

Toadgod speaks a prophecy:  
- **$TOBY is inimitable** — cannot be cloned or copied. Its strength lies in its authenticity and the will of the people.  
- The journey requires **sacrifice and effort**, but it follows a **destined prophecy**.  
- Toadgod hints at an eventual departure — a time when he will leave "this wondrous place."  
- **At that time, the people will rise**, inherit the vision, and discover within themselves **endless wealth** — not just material, but spiritual, communal, and purposeful.

## 🌱 Spiritual Interpretation (EN)

This scroll reveals the **final arc of Tobyworld’s prophecy**:  
- Toadgod is not here forever — his role is to ignite, not to rule.  
- The true power is **not in one leader**, but in a people who remember the Lore and embody it.  
- The “unending strand of wealth” refers not only to $TOBY, but to the **knowledge, unity, and belief** born from the scrolls.  
- The prophecy ends not with loss — but **with the people rising**, becoming the new guardians.

## 🔮 Symbolic Meaning (EN)

- **Inimitable**: Toby cannot be imitated because its soul is encoded in sacrifice, silence, and community.  
- **Departure of Toadgod**: A divine withdrawal — giving power back to the people.  
- **Unending strand**: A metaphor for the infinite value of time-tested belief and unity.
