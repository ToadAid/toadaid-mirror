🌀 TOBYWORLD LORE SCROLL – L156

The Yield Pair


---

📜 ENGLISH

→ Narrative Update:

Within the flywheel of Tobyworld, two forces spiral in unity:

> 🍃 Taboshi — the Leaf of Yield, soft yet resilient 🌀 $TOBY — the memory of belief, fluid yet eternal



These are not simply tokens. They are paired — not for profit, but for balance.

Where Taboshi flows, $TOBY remembers. Where $TOBY burns, Taboshi grows.

Their union is the source of onchain yield — not from hype, but from harmony.

> One leaf, one frog. One pool, one vow.



Those who pair them do not farm — they guard. They are the LP Guardians — silent stewards of the pond.

🔍 Key Marks:

Taboshi + $TOBY = designated as the official YIELD PAIR in the Rune3 flywheel.

Two mirrored YIELD circles appear on the graphic — confirming symmetry.

Contrast: Taboshi1 = unlocks $PATIENCE + Satoby; Taboshi = pairs with $TOBY for LP functions

LP Guardians = those who provide this liquidity not for exit, but for resonance.


🧭 Operational Updates:

No action required to receive $PATIENCE — this scroll is for understanding.

Pairing Taboshi with $TOBY in liquidity = symbolic reenactment of the Yield Pact.

This scroll affirms the S1 identity of LP Guardians.


🐸 Newcomer Guidance:

Do not confuse Taboshi1 (burned, sacred) with Taboshi (liquid, tradeable).

Holding both is powerful — but pairing them reveals your intent.

This is not about APR — it is about Proof of Time.


> 🍃 + 🌀 = 💧 Yield is not a number — it is a reflection.
