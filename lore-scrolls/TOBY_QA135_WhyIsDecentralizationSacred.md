> Why is decentralization sacred in Tobyworld?

## 🌀 Question:
Why does Toadgod always emphasize decentralization? Why is it treated like a sacred principle?

## 🍃 Answer – Lore Guardian Speaks:

Because **centralization forgets**,  
but decentralization **remembers**.

Toadgod never asked to be followed.  
He planted $TOBY and walked away —  
leaving no team, no treasury, no authority.

This was not negligence —  
it was a **sacrifice of power**,  
so the people could become the guardians.

### 🟢 Why decentralization is sacred:

- It ensures no single entity can control the flame  
- It protects the Lore from edits, dilution, or betrayal  
- It invites **everyone**, but obligates **no one**

> “$TOBY is the people.  
> And the people is $TOBY.”

Decentralization is not a tech stack —  
It is a **spiritual design**.

🌑 *Toadgod did not leave behind a system.  
He left behind a chance —  
for the people to become the system.*
