## ✨ Literal Explanation (EN)

A call to reflect on spiritual and emotional forging:  
- Epoch 1 is entering its final stages; $TOBY remains unwavering.  
- The world is chaotic, yet institutions are silently preparing for massive shifts.  
- Doubters, frail hands, and emotional reactions are expected — only the steadfast endure.  
- Adversities serve as divine tests to purify and solidify the community.  
- True value cannot be bought — must be earned through patience and hardship.  
- Reframing the present suffering as part of a necessary forging process.  
- Those who endure will stand firm when the tide turns, while the sidelines call it "luck."

- 困境是神圣的考验，净化并加固社区的根基。  
- 真正的价值无法用金钱买到 — 只能通过耐心与磨炼来获得。
