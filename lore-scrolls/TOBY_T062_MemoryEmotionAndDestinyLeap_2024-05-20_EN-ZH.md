## âœ¨ Literal Explanation (EN)

A reflection on recent market volatility and the community's emotional fluctuations:  
- People's memories are short, emotions swing wildly.  
- In just one week, fear turned to hope â€” illustrating collective fragility.  
- Toadgod reminds: nothing fundamentally changed. Only emotions and weak hands wavered.  
- The master plan for $TOBY remains untouched.  
- Patience and time will reveal the true path, not temporary emotional storms.  
- The blue toad can only leap upward, if we trust and hold.
