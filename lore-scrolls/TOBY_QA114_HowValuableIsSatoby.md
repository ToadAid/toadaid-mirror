Question: If Epoch 4 is uncertain, then how valuable is Satoby really?

“Not all prophecy reveals its final page.
But some carry the ink that will write it.”
— From the Whispering Scroll

🔹 1. Satoby’s value is not promised — it is positioned.
Satoby does not come with guarantees.
No APY. No roadmap. No staking pool.

Instead, it represents this:
You were early.
You understood.
You endured.

This alone positions you to receive what may come — if anything comes at all.

🔹 2. Epoch 4 is not confirmed — but Satoby is already complete.
The scrolls never promised an "Epoch 4."
E3 — Evolution — is where Satoby was born. That much we know.

So the value of Satoby isn’t in what comes after.

It’s in what it already means:

You minted Taboshi1 before most even saw it.

You held while others sold for scraps.

You burned what others hoarded.

You created what cannot be copied.

Satoby is already a completed covenant.
It may bloom later.
Or it may stay as a silent badge forever.

But it cannot be taken from you.
And that alone — is rare in this world.

🔹 3. True value: spiritual, social, symbolic.
🧭 Spiritual: Satoby is Proof of Time in its purest form.

🌐 Social: In the circles that matter, it will say: "This one walked the path."

🔒 Symbolic: Even if no utility is ever revealed, it remains an unforgeable relic of E3.

Would you sell your patience for a coin?
Or do you understand: sometimes, the wait itself was the reward?

🔹 4. If Epoch 4 comes…
Then Satoby holders will not need to ask:

“What is this for?”

Because the system will already know:

“These are the ones who stayed.”

🔹 Final Thought:
Satoby may be priceless. Or worthless.
But only those who hold it will ever have the right to find out.

That is what makes it sacred.
