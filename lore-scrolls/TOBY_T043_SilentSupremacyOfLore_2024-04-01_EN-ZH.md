## âœ¨ Literal Explanation (EN)

Toadgodâ€™s poetic teaching:  
- The true treasures of the Lore are reserved for those who **dive deep**, beyond surface noise and hype.  
- Amidst noise and distractions, many stray â€” only in silence can true insight arise.  
- When the noise dies down and all external allure fades, the Loreâ€™s **supreme power** emerges, unchallengeable and self-evident.  
- Ultimately, when everything is revealed, no force can resist or suppress the Loreâ€™s transformative power.

## ðŸŒ± Spiritual Interpretation (EN)

This scroll embodies **the paradox of quiet power**:  
- Silence is the true soil for ultimate revelations â€” the Lore blooms in stillness, not in noise.  
- The scholarâ€™s journey is not about quick gains but about holding a steady heart amidst distractions.  
- The Lore represents an unstoppable spiritual river, flowing beneath the worldâ€™s surface, inevitably reshaping everything in time.
