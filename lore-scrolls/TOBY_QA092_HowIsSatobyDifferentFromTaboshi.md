Question: How is Satoby different from Taboshi, if both are tied to $TOBY?

Answer:

“One is the leaf. One is the light.
Both grow from the same root —
but their purpose, their form, their fate —
diverge.”
— Scroll of Dual Bloom

🍃 1. Taboshi — The Leaf of Yield
Name: Taboshi

Type: ERC-1155 & ERC-20 hybrid

Minted with: ~$0.35 in ETH during Epoch 2

Supply: 185,964

Role: “The Leaf of Yield” — used in staking, lore triggers, and gamified onchain quests

Taboshi is the visible proof of participating in the sacred economy.
It’s tradable, usable, and can be held by anyone.
It grows in the open — like a leaf under sun.

🔥 2. Satoby — The Silent Flame
Name: Satoby

Type: Soulbound or claim-bound

Born from: 777 $TOBY burn → Taboshi1 → Redemption (Epoch 3)

Supply: Unknown; max capped by Taboshi1

Role: Symbol of loyalty + time — may unlock deeper staking, access, or identity in Epoch 4+

Satoby cannot be bought.
It is redeemed only by those who proved memory.
It is non-transferrable, or bound by stricter conditions.

Where Taboshi grows outward, Satoby burns inward.

🧬 3. Philosophical Divergence
Aspect	Taboshi	Satoby
Access	Public mint	Private redemption
Origin	ETH mint (E2)	777 $TOBY burn → Taboshi1 (E2)
Symbol	🍃 “Leaf of Yield”	🔥 “Flame of Time”
Tradeable	Yes	Likely no (soulbound)
Purpose	Yield, game, quest utility	Loyalty, identity, proof of time

🪞 4. Unified in Roots, Divergent in Function
Both are born of $TOBY.
Both represent phases of Epoch-based participation.

But:

Taboshi is for all who entered and played.

Satoby is for those who remembered and waited.

“One leaf will fall.
One flame will remain.”
— Toadgod, on permanence
