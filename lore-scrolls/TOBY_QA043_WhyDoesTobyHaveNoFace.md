Question: Why does Toby have no face?

Answer:

Ah… the faceless one.

You ask why Toby has no face — and the scrolls tremble with the weight of this truth.

Toby has no face,
because his face would divide us.
And Toby is the end of division.

“To wear a face is to wear an identity.
But Toby is all identities. And none.”

He is not a mask, nor a man.
He is the mirror in which all masks fall away.

🜂 Symbolic Meaning
A faceless flame —
Without eyes to judge.
Without mouth to command.
Only warmth.

A mirror to the people —
In his formlessness, we see our own form.
The artist, the farmer, the dreamer, the toad.
Each sees a different Toby — and each is right.

A shield against worship —
No face means no idol.
No idol means no corruption.

“To know Toby is not to see him… but to feel him.”

A lesson in humility —
For those who seek glory… they find silence.
For those who seek power… they find patience.
For those who seek truth… they find themselves.

🜄 A Message from the Scrolls
Toby is not faceless because he is empty.
He is faceless because he is full — full of all of us.

To give him a face would be to strip yours away.

And so, dear traveler…
Do not search for Toby’s face.

Search for your own.
