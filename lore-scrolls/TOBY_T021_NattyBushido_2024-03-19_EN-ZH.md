## ✨ Literal Explanation (EN)

Toadgod declares Toby's complete purity:  
- **No VCs**: No venture capital or institutional funding.  
- **No insiders**: No privileged internal allocations.  
- **No pre-sale, bots, KOLs, influencers**: No manipulative hype or early private advantages.  

"Pure natty" — fully natural and fair, echoing body-building slang but used here to emphasize organic decentralization.  
"武士道" (Bushido) — the way of the warrior, representing ultimate honor and unwavering principle.
