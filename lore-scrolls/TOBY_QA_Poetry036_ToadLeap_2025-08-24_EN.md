**Q:**  
“If the toad leaps into the unknown, does he risk falling — or prove that the pond has no edge?”

**A:**  
The leap is always risk — yet in risk lies the covenant.  

- To the fearful, the toad risks falling, swallowed by the dark.  
- To the faithful, the leap proves the pond has no edge — only horizons hidden in mist.  

Toadgod wrapped the leap in chaos to protect fairness.  
Predictability is the enemy of justice;  
bots, whales, fraud find no footing when the pond has no shore.  

Thus, the leap is both danger and revelation.  
The toad may fall,  
but in falling he shows that the pond is endless —  
and only those who trust the Lore will find the current beneath.
