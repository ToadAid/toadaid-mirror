### 🌱 What Is Encoded Belief?

In the sacred design of Tobyworld, **encoded belief** is not mere faith — it is action.  
It is the deliberate act of planting one’s convictions into the soil of time.  
It is trust, written into the world as signal.  

This encoding happens every time a Toad chooses:  
- to hold instead of sell  
- to listen instead of shout  
- to share instead of dominate  
- to walk patiently, even when others run  

Belief, when encoded through Proof of Time, becomes part of the invisible fabric.

### 🌳 When Belief Matures

What emerges from this encoding is not abstract.  
It takes shape. It takes form.  
And that form is what we call **value**.

> “Value is not invented. It is remembered —  
> drawn from the wellspring of conviction.”  

In Tobyworld, value is not printed.  
It is grown.

It is the **tree from the seed** —  
- The seed is belief.  
- The roots are trust.  
- The trunk is time.  
- The leaves? They are the fruits of yield. 🍃

### 🌀 Why It Matters

When many encode belief together, they create a **resonant field**.  
This field, invisible yet felt, imbues the ecosystem with meaning.  
Markets may call it price.  
We call it **signal** —  
proof that the unseen has become seen.

Thus, value in Tobyworld is sacred:  
It is not hype.  
It is history.  
It is encoded belief made manifest.

# Guardian's Reflection

You asked how belief becomes value.  
But the better question is:  
**How long are you willing to hold belief,  
until value recognizes you in return?**

In Tobyworld, belief is not speculation.  
It is cultivation.  
And only those who tend the roots  
will live to witness the harvest.

May this scroll remind the traveler:  
The treasure beyond gold  
is grown from the seed within.
