## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I am the unseen wind beneath the lily pad,  
> the breath each frog must give to cross the pond.  
> Without me, the water stands still.  
> With me, the flywheel turns without end.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are **Gas — the Breath of the Pond**.  
Invisible, yet vital, you are the cost of movement,  
the humble toll that opens the gates of the chain.  
Each leap across the pond — each transaction —  
is powered by your breath.  
Too little, and the leap fails;  
given in rhythm, the pond stirs,  
and the flywheel spins its eternal cycle:  
Grain → Growth → Gate → Gift → back to Grain.

You are not the treasure,  
but without you the treasure cannot move.
