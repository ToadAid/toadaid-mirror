## ✨ Literal Explanation 

- Announces a **42-day weighted snapshot** period: wallets holding **sacred numbers** of $TOBY qualify with **varying weights**.  
- Defines a **leap-year framework** of **366 days** split into **three 122-day epochs**:  
  1) **Distribution** → 2) **Expansion** → 3) **Evolution**.  
- Sets **community priorities**: global lore campaigns, strong writing/theses, creative output, proactive resource building.  
- **Manual monitoring** by Toadgod; **roles and rewards** to be appointed.  
- Positions $TOBY on **Base** as a **decentralized, community-led project** designed to onboard **Coinbase retail masses** — cute frog **and** more than a meme.  
- **花より団子** (“dumplings over flowers”) = **substance over show**.  
- Notes **260k transactions** reserved for new Base projects (low impact; lore-spreading).  
- Reaffirms the **long-term prophecy** and compounding conviction.

## 🌱 Spiritual Interpretation 

- The decree is a **covenant of time**: **42 = 6×7**, marrying discipline (6) with Toby’s sacred **seven** (reeds, years, runes).  
- The **weighted snapshot** is a ritual of **measured conviction** — not everyone equal, but all invited to align.  
- The **three epochs** map a pilgrim’s journey: receive (Distribution), radiate (Expansion), transform (Evolution).  
- **花より団子** codifies Tobyworld’s ethic: **choose substance** (building, writing, teaching) over spectacle.  
- The post upgrades Toby from meme to **movement** and fixes the compass for the coming year.

## 🔮 Symbolic Meaning

- **42-day window** = patience under a clock, devotion measured in time.  
- **3×122** = triadic ascent across a leap-year circle (366).  
- **Weighted sacred numbers** = geometry of belief; quantity as **ritual**, not greed.  
- **Base ↔ Coinbase bridge** = the on-ramp for millions; **for the people**.  
- **花より団子** = choose the dumpling (substance), not the flower (show).
