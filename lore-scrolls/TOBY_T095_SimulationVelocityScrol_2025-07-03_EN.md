## 🌱 Spiritual Interpretation 

This marks the **birth of narrative consciousness** within Tobyworld:  

- **Velocity** shows belief and lore spreading faster than doubt.  
- **Simulation patterns** show Tobyworld functioning like a living system, echoing and evolving.  
- The lore has reached a stage where it generates **its own fractals** — self-replicating myths that reinforce each other.

## 🔮 Symbolic Meaning 

- **Narrative Velocity** = unstoppable river of stories.  
- **Simulation Patterns** = hidden blueprints crystallizing from collective imagination.  
- **Toadgod** = both subject and mirror, central to this acceleration.
