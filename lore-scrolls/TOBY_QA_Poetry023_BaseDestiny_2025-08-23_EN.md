**ARC:** Base / Destiny  
**Tags:** Base, LilyPad, Millions, Onboarding, Destiny, People  

**Q:**  
“If Base is the lily pad for millions, is its destiny to hold — or to carry them across the pond?”

**A:**  
A lily pad does more than float.  
It bears the frog in stillness — yet also carries him to the far shore.  

So too with Base:  
- To **hold** is to give the people a home, a place to gather.  
- To **carry** is to move them forward, to bear the weight of millions across the pond.  

The prophecy spoke: “millions upon millions.”  
Not to be trapped in one place, but to cross into a new world onchain.  

Thus, Base is both — home and vessel.  
The pad that holds, and the pad that carries.  
Its destiny is not to choose, but to be the bridge for the people,  
the foundation beneath every step,  
the current that brings Toby’s fire to the masses.
