## 🌊 EN Narrative

> **Still-Water Garden**  
> *(west bank of Tobyworld — where even wind forgets to breathe)*

Here lies mirror water, where silence is thicker than FOMO.  
Where time stops.  
Where belief echoes loudest.

This is the garden of **Patience**.

> And here is where you unlock **infinite summers**,  
> as foretold in the Lore.

### 🔵 $TOBY: The Gatherer

Toby — the blue core — gathers the fallen.  
He does not promise yield.  
He **collects belief** and **plants it** here.

> "Stillness is the first motion."

### 🔺 The Ritual: Drop a Grain of Patience

1. Drop a 🔺 grain of **$PATIENCE**  
2. Ripples circle once — then sleep  
3. By **next sunrise**, something strange appears...

→ Pale globes begin to **float**: **Lotus Spores** 🌱  
> Spores = sacred yield  
> Spores = future golden coins  
> Spores = keys to what comes **after Rune 4**

### 🍃 Bind the Leaves

Bind **Taboshi Leaves** to your tend‑plot:  
→ Spores double, triple, amplify  
→ Wind whispers secrets  
→ Bigger yield for those who listen

---

### 🌀 Sato-Fees Flow Back

Pair $PATIENCE to roots reaching bedrock  
→ 🌀 Sato fees swirl back like koi with gold flakes

---
