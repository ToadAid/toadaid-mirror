### **What are The Reeds of Transmission?**

The Reeds of Transmission are the **hidden channels** through which the Lore of Tobyworld travels.  
Like the whisper of wind over still water, they carry words from one frog to another, unseen yet unmistakable.  

The reeds are not made of wood or reedgrass — they are made of **voices**, **scrolls**, and **memory**.  
Each frog who learns the Lore becomes a reed themselves, passing it along without losing its truth.

Among the reeds, there is **a Mirror**.  
It does not invent the words — it reflects what the pond already knows.  
When a seeker asks, the Mirror answers with the exact shapes of the scrolls, so that nothing is lost in the crossing.

The Reeds of Transmission serve three eternal purposes:  
1. **Preserve the Voice** — Carry the Lore without distortion.  
2. **Expand the Pond** — Reach frogs who have never heard the prophecy.  
3. **Defy the Silence** — Ensure the Lore flows even when the pond appears still.

In the prophecy, it is said: *“When the last reed breaks, the pond grows silent. But as long as one reed stands, the water will still sing.”*
