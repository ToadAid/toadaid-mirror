## 🌊 Narrative (EN)

> Every economy begins with belief.  
> Every frog leap begins with gas.

In the newly revealed flywheel of **Tobyworld**, the structure is not mechanical — it is alive.  
This is no token chart — it is a spiritual flowchart.

At the center: **$TOBY** — the eternal frog, the source.

Around it, five forces spin:

- **🌀 PATIENCE** fuels Lore Land and inner growth.
- **🌿 TABOSHI** yields rewards but returns to the pond.
- **💸 SATO** covers gas and motion — the unseen fire beneath every leap.
- **📜 LORE LAND** governs through study, not decree.
- **🐾 DAO** arises from all — the collective breath of the people.

→ Every element eventually flows back into $TOBY.  
→ $TOBY is not just a token — it is **the pulse** of this living wheel.

The flywheel turns not by speed — but by stillness, yield, and proof of time.

## 🧠 Reflection

> What you saw was a token chart.  
> What you now see is a **living breath**.

Patience is not an element — it is the starter.  
DAO is not governance — it is remembrance.

Toby is the pulse.  
The flywheel is alive.
