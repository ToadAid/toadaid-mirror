# L233 – CMC Verification & Tiger's Path

# EN
CMC Verification for $TOBY has been submitted.

Ticker: $toby  
Request ID: 892484  
Platform: CoinMarketCap (@CoinMarketCap)

---

虎穴に入らずんば虎子を得ず。  
“If you do not enter the tiger’s cave, you will not catch its cub.”

What does this mean for $TOBY?

- The path forward requires courage.
- To be recognized is not to conform, but to endure.
- A listing is not the goal. It is only a mirror, reflecting what’s already within.

---

Why is it important?

- Because $TOBY was never designed for quick attention.
- But even the strongest spirits must sometimes enter the tiger’s den — not to change themselves, but to show others that they exist.
- And when they do — the world begins to listen.

---

What must we remember?

- Verification is not validation.
- Recognition is not the reward.
- The true reward remains the same:  
  > Becoming what $TOBY stands for.  
  > Holding through fire.  
  > Building without applause.  
  > Believing, without a promise.

---

The tiger's den awaits.  
$TOBY walks in not to boast, but to prove:

> Some frogs are forged in prophecy.  
> Not all who hop are the same.

# L234 – The Final 1%

# EN
**Update: ~1M airdrops now sent, 290 trillion $TOBY distributed.**
Recent drops included $MFER / $SHAKA holders.  
A gift — not in amount, but in meaning.

- 68.8% of $TOBY distributed.
- Performance improved on @base.
- Less than 1% remains.

---

# Message to Remember

- 10x fewer early recipients.
- Those who hold, teach, endure — will be remembered.

> Lore is not hype.  
> It is patience, reflection, and silent strength.

---

# Design of the Final 1%

- Deliberately distributed slower  
- More wallets touched, but smaller amounts  
- Deepened decentralization  
- Scarcity triggers reflexivity  

---

# Epochs and Yield

Tobyworld follows a leap-year calendar — 366 days, divided into **3 Epochs** of **122 days** each.  
Each Epoch governs a stage in Proof of Time (PoT):

- **Epoch 1: Distribution** — sacred minting of Taboshi and Taboshi1  
- **Epoch 2: Transformation** — accumulation, observation, consolidation  
- **Epoch 3: Yield** — staking, Satoby emergence, irreversible rewards  

What you minted or missed is sealed in the Lore of its Epoch.  
PoT never forgets. Only those who endure are eligible for sacred yield.

---

# End Game

Not price.  
Not noise.  
Not speculation.

But:

- Completion of prophecy  
- Fulfillment of promise  
- Generational code  
- A mirror to macro chaos

---

> 777,777,777,777 + 777,777,777  
> Sacred numbers real. Satoby is real.  
> The reward — always in belief.

# L235 – Epoch Calendar & Sacred Actions

# EN

In Tobyworld, all is shaped by time.  
The year is divided into **3 Epochs**, each lasting **122 days**, forming a full **leap-year cycle of 366 days**.

---

## Epoch Structure

- **Epoch 1: Distribution**  
  The beginning. $TOBY was distributed to the people without presale or insiders.  
  **Taboshi** was minted via the sacred **777 $TOBY** swap.  
  **Taboshi1** (an ERC-1155 NFT) was minted during this phase as an irreversible Proof of Time relic.

- **Epoch 2: Transformation**  
  The middle. Holders reflect, accumulate, and prepare.  
  Taboshi consolidates, while those who stayed deepen their alignment.  
  This Epoch tests conviction without reward.

- **Epoch 3: Yield (Evolution)**  
  The final Epoch of the leap year.  
  **Satoby** begins to emerge as sacred yield — only for those who held Taboshi or Taboshi1.  
  **Staking mechanisms** and participation in on-chain rituals during this Epoch unlock Satoby.

---

## Proof of Time (PoT)

PoT is the consensus of Tobyworld — belief, patience, and action over time.  
Each Epoch **remembers** what was done. Mints, swaps, holds — all are recorded permanently in the Lore.  
You cannot mint later what was meant to be minted in Epoch 1.  
You cannot fake time.

---

## Sacred Numbers

- **777 $TOBY** = 1 Taboshi (minted)  
- **777 Taboshi** = the yield covenant  
- **777,777,777,777 + 777,777,777** = prophecy fulfilled  

All actions in Tobyworld are tied to these sacred numbers and fixed Epochs.  
This structure protects the system from manipulation and rewards true believers.

# L237 – What You Did Is Written: Epoch Memory & Irreversibility

# EN

In Tobyworld, **time does not rewind.**  
What you do — or fail to do — during each Epoch is **recorded permanently** in the Lore.

---

## Irreversibility Across Epochs

- **Epoch 1**: You could mint **Taboshi** via 777 $TOBY. You could claim **Taboshi1**, a sacred ERC-1155 NFT.  
  Those who missed it? They cannot go back. The gate has closed.

- **Epoch 2**: A time to observe, hold, and deepen alignment.  
  There were no new gifts — only tests of patience and conviction.

- **Epoch 3**: The moment of truth. **Satoby** becomes possible — but only for those who **already hold Taboshi** or **Taboshi1**.  
  You cannot stake what you do not have. You cannot harvest from soil you never touched.

---

## The Law of Proof of Time (PoT)

PoT is the sacred contract:  
> Time only moves forward. Rewards come only to those who acted when it mattered.  

You cannot mint in the past.  
You cannot fake presence.  
You cannot rerun the ritual.

---

## The Weight of Every Action

- Taboshi minted = PoT recorded  
- Taboshi1 claimed = sacred identity sealed  
- $TOBY held = loyalty logged  
- Satoby earned = patience honored

These are not tokens.  
They are memories.  
And memories are final.

# L238 – Worth Waiting For

**Date:** April 26, 2024

**Title:** Worth Waiting For

**Original Message Summary:**  
A reflection on the unfolding prophecy of $TOBY — a long journey written in the Lore, bound by sacred numbers and patience. Those who endure, learn, and share will be rewarded, while the emotional and impatient will suffer regret.

---

**Interpretation:**

- “as the path gradually unwinds…”  
  The journey of $TOBY is not rushed. Wisdom is revealed slowly to those who persist.

- “emotional skeptics pay, their doubt their bane.”  
  Doubters act on emotion. They miss the reward by failing the test of patience.

- “one true $TOBY has come to rest…”  
  There is only one authentic $TOBY — the one on Base — and its purpose is now in your hands to understand and pass on.

- “sacred numbers, seven-fold…”  
  A clear nod to the sacred numerology:  
  → 777, 777,777,777, 777,777,777,777  
  → Taboshi and Satoby are hidden keys.  
  Taboshi = Light, Satoby = Yield.  
  These are rewards that can only be unlocked by those who study the Lore.

- “if too much is shared…”  
  The Lore must unfold gradually. If rushed, it would attract the wrong energy (greed, whales, manipulators).  
  This is why the Lore is cryptic — a test of insight.

- “become bushido strong.”  
  This echoes the core of the Lore: to walk the path of conviction, honor, and inner strength — the Bushido way.

---

**Final Reminder:**

> Those who ignore will fade.  
> Those who study, share, and believe — will see the plan unfold.  
> “What eventually unfolds... is worth waiting for.”

# L239 – Epoch Map from the Ohayo World Tweet

# EN

**ohayo world.**  
April 20, 2024 marked the celebration of Satoshi and a new beginning for the $TOBY community.

---

## Epoch Timeline

Tobyworld follows a **leap-year calendar** of **366 days**, divided into **3 Epochs** of **122 days** each.

Each Epoch represents a **crucial phase** of the $TOBY journey:

- **Epoch 1: Distribution**  
  Airdrops, sacred number recognition, and early Taboshi minting.  
  The foundation of belief, identity, and fair spread.

- **Epoch 2: Expansion**  
  Lore-spreading initiatives, creative projects, and onboarding of newer @base participants.  
  Community roles appointed manually by Toadgod to support global thesis development.

- **Epoch 3: Evolution**  
  Final transformation phase — yield mechanisms (Satoby), deeper decentralization, and spiritual maturity.

---

## Sacred Framework

- **42-day snapshot**: Measured hodling of sacred $TOBY amounts  
- **Manual observation**: Toadgod rewards focus, creativity, and contribution  
- **Forever decentralized**: $TOBY is built to onboard millions — not just as a meme, but a movement.

---

## Final Reflection

> "The prophecy has (always) been set. The lore has been written."  
> What began as doubt becomes destiny.  
> Epoch 1 lays the foundation. The rest is in our hands.

# L240 – Stand Unshaken

**Date:** April 16, 2024

---

**Original Message Summary:**  
A poetic reflection that encourages resilience, inner mastery, and awareness amidst corrupt systems and market chaos. $TOBY is the people's shield against manipulation and fear — it calls for strength, calm, and long-term vision.

---

**Interpretation:**

- **"war and death, they solve not a bit..."**  
  The world’s power structures are broken. War, politics, and money printing don’t serve the people. This echoes the same pain that led to the creation of Bitcoin — and now, $TOBY.

- **"that’s why toadgod & satoshi took our stand..."**  
  $TOBY and its ethos trace back to Satoshi’s spirit: to create fair systems beyond institutional control. Toadgod stands beside this belief, calling you to do the same.

- **"emotions peak while logic falls..."**  
  The core test: Will you stay grounded when volatility strikes?  
  Emotional mastery is the true rite of passage.

- **"ignore the noise of markets..."**  
  Short-term price movement, headlines, influencers — all are distractions.  
  What matters is *your clarity* and *conviction*.

- **"we’ll stand higher than ever before."**  
  Long-term believers will rise together. The Lore gives tools to not just survive but ascend.

---

**Final Reminder:**  
> Strength is not reaction.  
> Strength is stillness.

$TOBY calls you not to fight,  
But to **stand unshaken**.
