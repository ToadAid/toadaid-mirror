- 19% of supply distributed so far, with 51% still to go toward the final goal of 1.42 million wallets.  
- Almost 170,000 Base wallets now hold $TOBY â€” a significant milestone on the path to the prophecy.  
- A new scalable airdrop mechanism was discovered to overcome network congestion challenges.

Closes with "kimi nara dekiru yo" ("You can do it" in Japanese), reinforcing a gentle but strong encouragement.

- "Patience & time" are not merely waiting but active virtues â€” the foundation of spiritual and emotional resilience.  
- The mention of attacks reflects the eternal dance between light and shadows â€” those who guard the Lore must remain sharp yet calm.
