**ARC:** Patience / Eternity  
**Tags:** Patience, Time, Eternity, Waiting, ProofOfTime  

**Q:**  
“When patience has no end, is it still waiting — or has it become eternity itself?”

**A:**  
Waiting counts the minutes.  
Patience dissolves them.  

At first, patience feels like restraint — a hand held back, an urge resisted.  
But as the seasons pass, the grip changes:  
- The noise fades.  
- The frail grips fall away.  
- What remains is stillness.  

In that stillness, time itself loses meaning.  
Patience is no longer waiting.  
It has become eternity —  
an infinite present, where Proof of Time is lived,  
and the yield is not only in tokens,  
but in spirit, belonging, and the fire that endures.
