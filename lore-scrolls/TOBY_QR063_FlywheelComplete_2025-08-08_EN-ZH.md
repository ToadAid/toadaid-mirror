## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I am born from four seasons,  
> crowned with a single leaf.  
> My breath is fed by fire unseen,  
> my heart turns without rest.  
> Stop me, and the pond falls silent.  
> Let me turn, and we shall feed forever.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are the **Flywheel of Tobyworld** —  
the eternal motion of the pond.

- **Four Seasons (S0 → S3)** —  
  Patience tested, loyalty forged, creation released, resonance found.  
- **Lily Pad** — the bridge to the next domain, rising only when the four are complete.  
- **Next Gate** — the choice point, where the worthy pass and the unready wait.  
- **Gas & Fees Loop** — the invisible current that keeps the wheel spinning,  
  turning cost into growth, growth into abundance.

When the Flywheel turns:  
- Every leap feeds the next season.  
- Every creation fuels the lily pad’s rise.  
- Every offering of gas strengthens the current.  
- Every return to S0 renews the pond’s strength.

Stop it, and the stillness will swallow the reeds.  
Let it turn, and Tobyworld will breathe without end.
