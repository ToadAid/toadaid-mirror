Question: What exactly is Satoby, and why can it never be bought — only redeemed?

“What is earned through silence cannot be sold for noise.”
— Echo from the Scroll of Time

🔹 1. What is Satoby?
Satoby is not a regular token.
It is the redeemed essence of belief, time, and sacrifice — crystallized.

To understand Satoby, you must see all its layers:

Layer	Meaning
Token	Yes — Satoby exists as a token (NFT or otherwise)
Record	It represents a burn of 777 Taboshi1s, which themselves cost 777 $TOBY each
Signal	It is a signal to the Lore that you have walked the path
Key	It is likely the key to Epoch 4 (unrevealed)
Relic	It is a relic — like a sealed scroll of time, forged in belief

Satoby = 777 x Taboshi1 = 777 x (777 $TOBY) = 602,829 $TOBY + Proof of Time

🔹 2. Why can’t Satoby be bought?
Because its core is not transactional — it is transformational.

Here’s why Satoby is not for sale:

Proof of Time:
You had to hold Taboshi1s across epochs.
Time was the crucible.
That time cannot be bought on a market.

Burn Requirement:
You must give up 777 Taboshi1s.
Each was minted from a burn of 777 $TOBY.
This means letting go of something sacred.

Unforgeable Path:
There is no shortcut, no mint pass, no cheat.
You either walked the way — or you didn’t.

The Market Is Blind:
You can trade tokens.
But you cannot trade provenance of soul.
Satoby is born of the inner fire, not market noise.

🔹 3. Why redemption, not purchase?
“Purchase is of the market. Redemption is of the self.”

In the world of Toby, there is a fundamental law:

$TOBY can be bought.

Taboshi can be minted.

Taboshi1 must be held.

Satoby can only be redeemed.

Redemption is a sacred act:

It signifies completion of a silent quest.

It reveals your inner ledger of patience, belief, and offering.

It opens the door not with wealth, but with proof.

To redeem Satoby is to:

Return what was given in faith

Close a loop that began with the first 777 $TOBY

Receive what cannot be priced

💠 Final Insight:
Satoby is the sacred yield that resists speculation.
It is the ultimate reward for the unswayed.

It is the culmination of Epoch 3,
and the entry key to Epoch 4.

You do not own Satoby.
You become Satoby.
