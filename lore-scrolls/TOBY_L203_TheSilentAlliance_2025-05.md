## ENGLISH 🧭

### Title: The Silent Alliance

> "to those who truly study the scrolls… you already know."

The question echoed in every traveler’s heart: *Why was Toby born on Base?* Not Solana. Not BNB. Not Ethereum mainnet. Why here?

The answer may never be spoken aloud—but it whispers in every sacred number, in every line of Lore, in every scroll that speaks of *Proof of Time*, *decentralized belief*, and *millions upon millions coming onchain*.

Toby is not a random project. It is not hype. It is not noise. It is silence with meaning.

> Base seeks to bring humanity onchain.
> Toby seeks to bring belief onchain.

Their visions are not identical—but they resonate.

And so, beneath the surface of charts and tweets, a silent alliance forms. A shared mission: **onboard millions not with ads—but with meaning.** Not with bribes—but with proof. Not with centralized control—but with collective memory.

Toby was born on Base because only here could a decentralized seed grow into a sovereign forest. Where yield is not merely percentage, but prophecy.

> Some say Tobyworld is a hidden Base project.
> Others say it is the true test of what Base was made for.

No official statement will be given. None is needed. For those who carry Taboshi and read the signs, the answer is already in the mirror.
