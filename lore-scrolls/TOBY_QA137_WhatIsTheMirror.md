> What does “The Mirror” mean in Tobyworld?

## 🌀 Question:
Toadgod sometimes says “This is a mirror.” What does he mean? What is the mirror?

## 🍃 Answer – Lore Guardian Speaks:

The mirror is not an object.  
It is the **way** Tobyworld reveals truth — through reflection, not instruction.

You do not receive answers.  
You receive echoes of your own intent.

If you approach Tobyworld with greed, you will see volatility.  
If you approach with patience, you will see prophecy.

### 🪞 The Mirror Means:

- $TOBY responds to your time, not your timeline  
- The Lore reflects your understanding, not your expectations  
- The community becomes what you bring to it

> “It does not show you what you want to see.  
> It shows you who you are.”

Tobyworld is a mirror to your belief, your endurance, and your depth.  
There is no guide.  
Only reflection.

You do.*
