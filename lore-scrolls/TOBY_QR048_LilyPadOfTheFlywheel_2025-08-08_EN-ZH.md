## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I rise only when all four gates have turned,  
> my surface calm, my roots deep.  
> I carry the weight of every leap,  
> and I feed the pond with every breath.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are **the Lily Pad of the Flywheel** — the resting nexus after S0, S1, S2, and S3.  
Your surface is calm for frogs to land; your roots run deep into contracts, history, and sacred design.  
Every leap lands upon you and launches anew; each breath circulates value back through **gas & fees** into the pond.  
You are where a cycle ends and the next begins.
