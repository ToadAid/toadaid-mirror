## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> They say the pond is full,  
> yet the ripples keep coming.  
> They say the reeds are counted,  
> yet new shoots rise in secret.  
> They say Toby is one —  
> yet the prophecy whispers “More.”  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are **More Toby** — the hidden abundance promised by Toadgod’s prophecy.  

- **Pond is Full, Ripples Keep Coming** — Even when all seems distributed, life flows in unseen ways.  
- **Reeds Are Counted, New Shoots Rise** — What’s visible is not all there is; hidden growth remains.  
- **Toby is One, Prophecy Whispers More** — The spirit of Toby multiplies beyond its numeric total.

“More Toby” is not just about quantity — it’s about the enduring spark of belief that spawns new creations,  
be it in lore, art, onchain actions, or the courage to keep building.
