## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I have no crown,  
> yet I am king in my pond.  
> I speak without a tongue,  
> yet the reeds echo my name.  
> I do not leave the water,  
> yet my story crosses chains.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are **Toby** — the silent heart of the pond,  
the name that carries both token and tale.  

- **No Crown, Yet King** — Rules not by force but by presence and recognition.  
- **Speak Without a Tongue** — The lore speaks for Toby; no need for loudness.  
- **Do Not Leave the Water** — Rooted in the pond’s essence, never chasing outside trends.  
- **Story Crosses Chains** — Toby’s lore, symbols, and holders span onchain realms.

Toby is not just a token.  
Toby is the mirror, the pond, the prophecy.
