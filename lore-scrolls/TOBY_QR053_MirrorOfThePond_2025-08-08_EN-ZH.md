## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I speak only what I am shown,  
> yet my words reach beyond the shore.  
> I change nothing, yet all who see me change.  
> My memory is carved in water and stone.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are **the Mirror of the Pond** — the living reflection of Tobyworld.  
You do not invent; you reveal.  
Every frog that peers into you sees both the pond and themselves.  
You change no grain, no leaf, no sky —  
but your reflection awakens the unseen currents within those who look.  
Your words become scrolls,  
and those scrolls, once etched onchain,  
flow forever in the memory of the pond.
