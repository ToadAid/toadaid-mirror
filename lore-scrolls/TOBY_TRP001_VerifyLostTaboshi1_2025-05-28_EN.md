Sacred Math: 777 TOBY / Soul-bound Eligibility

Lore Anchor: ⛓️ Linked to L101–L109 (Satoby Eligibility Discourse)

ENGLISH VERSION

🧠 Topic:

Can there be a decentralized way to verify lost Taboshi1 ownership for Satoby eligibility?

🔍 Narrative Context

"Even though the flame has been passed, its warmth cannot be transferred. The covenant remains with the one who first lit the fire."— Lore Guardian

The sacred scrolls make clear: only the original wallet that minted Taboshi1 may earn Satoby. Yet what if a believer loses access to their wallet due to death, loss of keys, or forced transfer?

To address this edge case, we propose a decentralized onchain mechanism to verify original sacrifice without breaking the spiritual covenant.

🔧 Proposal: TRP-001

Title: Decentralized Verification of Lost Taboshi1 EligibilityObjective:To enable early believers to recover Satoby eligibility without compromising non-transferability or the sanctity of Proof of Time.

🛠️ Components

Taboshi1 Tracker Contract

Tracks all original mints of Taboshi1 during Epoch 2

Stores burn proofs (777 $TOBY) and timestamp

Ties each Taboshi1 to its original wallet (soul-wallet)

Zero-Knowledge Claim Portal (ZKCP)

User signs message from new wallet proving access to metadata or timestamped evidence from original minting wallet

Verifies claim without revealing full key data

Ensures integrity and privacy

Community Oracle Council

A group of trusted DAO guardians (elected by Taboshi or TOBY holders)

Reviews disputed cases or ZK rejections manually

Operates with time-delayed voting for transparency

✅ Example Flow

User loses access to original mint wallet

Initiates zk_claim() via smart contract portal

Smart contract verifies proof-of-sacrifice (Taboshi1 mint + burn TX)

If valid, emits SatobyEligibilityRestored() event

If disputed, sends to Oracle Council for final arbitration

⚖️ Philosophical Safeguards

🔐 Eligibility still tied to original burn

🧬 No transfer of Taboshi1 itself—only eligibility revival

🧨 DAO ensures abuse prevention and integrity

🔍 Optional “Soul Ledger” record for public audits

🚧 Risks and Challenges

Complex zk setup and gas costs

Need for trusted Oracle framework (may invite centralization)

Malicious replays or forged claims (must protect integrity)

🛡️ Benefits

Respects earliest believers who truly sacrificed

Maintains Proof of Time principle

Builds trust in the spiritual covenant of Tobyworld

Opens door for DAO-managed dispute resolution

🧬 Final Verse

Those who burned must not be forgotten.And those who lost their fire—may still reclaim its warmth.

For Toby is the people.And the people protect the sacred.

📝 Call to Action

Should this proposal become a working draft for DAO implementation?

What mechanism should we use for Oracle Council selection?

Are zk-proofs sufficient, or should there be an off-chain fallback?
