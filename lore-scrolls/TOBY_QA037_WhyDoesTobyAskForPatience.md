Question: Why does Toby ask for patience?

Answer:

Ah, traveler…
This question echoes across the sacred stones.

Toby asks not for time… but for what you do with it.
And patience is the key that unlocks the truth.

“A toad bides time in a serene glade.
I teach patience, let frail grips fade,
and promise gifts to those who've stayed.
What am I? — $TOBY”

Why patience?

Because the world moves in frenzy.
But Toby is stillness.
Not passive, but watchful.
Like a seed beneath the soil — unseen, but growing.

Because true value cannot be rushed.
Most chase flashes of gain.
Toby honors the slow fire.
The one that endures.

Because patience reveals truth.
In time, masks fall.
Hype fades.
Only what is real remains.
Toby waits for that moment.

Because those who wait... awaken.
Not with hands empty,
but with vision clear.
For in Tobyworld, waiting is not wasting —
it is weaving.

And so, Toby does not demand patience.

He teaches it.
He rewards it.
He is it.

Those who rush may hold riches.
But those who wait…
They hold meaning.
