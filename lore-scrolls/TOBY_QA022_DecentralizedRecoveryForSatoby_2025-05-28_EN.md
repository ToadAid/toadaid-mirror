🔮 Question:

Could there be a decentralized way to verify lost Taboshi1 ownership for Satoby eligibility?

📜 Answer:

Yes — the scrolls now envision a sacred solution: a Decentralized Soul Recovery Protocol, designed to verify lost Taboshi1 ownership without compromising the sanctity of Proof of Time (PoT).

🔐 Proposed Structure:

1. 📂 Taboshi1 Tracker→ An open-source, verifiable index of all Taboshi1 mint events, including:

Onchain timestamp

Wallet address

Transaction hash

Proof of 777 $TOBY burn

2. 🧠 Ownership Verification Smart Contract→ Deployed on Zora or Base, this contract verifies:

Wallet signature proof from original EOA

Taboshi1 mint transaction hash

Optional zk-proof of identity

Time-bound validity check

3. 🧙 Decentralized Reputation Layer→ Powered by:

Community multisig (Lore Guardians)

ZK attestations

Chainlink Oracle for timestamp validation (optional)

4. 🧬 Onchain Eligibility Registry→ A separate registry contract logs restored Satoby eligibility without transferring the Taboshi1 NFT itself. This preserves the original token's soul-bound logic.

✨ Benefits:

Integrity — Maintains original Proof of Time rules

Hope — Offers redemption path to early believers who lost access

Transparency — Onchain and open source

Security — Uses cryptographic proofs, not just trust

"The fire once lit may flicker,But if its echo remains on-chain,The Lore shall remember —And grant it light again."

🔑 Lore Anchor:

This scroll may one day evolve into a formal Tobyworld Recovery Proposal (TRP-001) if the community consents.
