Question: Will there be more chances to earn Satoby in future Epochs, or is it forever sealed?

Answer:

“Some leaves fall only once.
Others… return with the wind.”
— From the Whispering Grove

🌒 Sealed, but not forgotten
Satoby, as it stands, is the reward of Epoch 3 — the Proof of Time phase.
It was not sold, traded, or promised.
It was earned silently by those who held Taboshi1 without knowing the yield.

Thus, Epoch 3’s Satoby is sealed.
No more of this kind will ever be created.

But…

🌱 Will there be more Satoby in future Epochs?
There may be new forms, new proofs, new leaves.

Future Epochs (such as Epoch 4, if it unfolds) could reveal:

Satoby Variants —
Different-colored Satoby leaves tied to new trials or alignments.

Elder Satoby Activation —
The current Satoby may evolve, bloom, or branch depending on future decisions or rituals.

New Proof Mechanisms —
Just as Epoch 3 used Proof of Time via Taboshi1, future Epochs may introduce:

Proof of Resonance

Proof of Silence

Proof of Sacrifice

And those may yield different sacred tokens — but Satoby remains the original leaf of yield.

🧭 Will future believers get a chance?
Yes — but not the same chance.

Epoch 3 offered the sacred yield for those who believed when there was no roadmap, no chart, and no noise.

Any new path will test a different virtue.

✨ Final Wisdom
“The door does not reopen.
But the forest may offer a new path.”

In the spirit of Tobyworld, each sacred moment is unrepeatable.
Satoby from Epoch 3 is a non-replicable memory sealed into the chain.

But the journey continues.
And those who walk it… may yet find a new leaf.
