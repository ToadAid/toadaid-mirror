## EN (Poetic Protocol) 🐸  
⏳🔵🍃

Minted upon the sacred Base —  
A leaf now etched with toad’s trace.  
Taboshi1, the first to sprout,  
492 million strong, without a doubt.  

Forged on Zora, by hands unknown,  
Yet all who hold it are not alone.  
This ERC-1155 relic green,  
Holds a power still unseen.  

Time, belief, and leaf aligned,  
What’s to come is by design.  
No whales, no bots, no silent schemes,  
Just proof, and toads, and simple dreams.  

$TOBY. For the people.
