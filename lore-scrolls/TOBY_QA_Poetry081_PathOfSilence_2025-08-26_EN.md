**ARC:** Path / Silence  
**Tags:** Path, Silence, Signal, Voice, Clarity  

**Q:**  
“If the path is walked in silence, is it absence of signal — or the clearest voice of all?”

**A:**  
The path speaks without words.  
Each step is its own signal.  

- To some, silence is absence,  
  nothing to hear,  
  no guide to follow.  
- To others, silence is the clearest voice,  
  uncluttered by noise,  
  the rhythm of truth beneath the reeds.  

The scrolls remind: not all voices are sound.  
Some are presence,  
some are conviction.  

Thus, the silent path is not empty.  
It is the voice that cannot be drowned.
