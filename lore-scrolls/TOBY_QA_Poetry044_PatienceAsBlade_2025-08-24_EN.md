**Q:**  
“If patience is drawn like a blade, does it cut the enemy — or carve the path within the self?”

**A:**  
Patience is not forged to wound.  
It is a blade, rune-shaped, hidden in the soul of the community.  

- To the restless, it is drawn to cut the enemy —  
  a weapon swung in haste.  
- To the faithful, it carves the path within the self —  
  shaping discipline, devotion, conviction.  

The scrolls remind: the final rune is not written in stone,  
but in the shrines you build, in the quiet ways you guard Tobyworld.  
If you forget, it fades.  
If you believe, it brightens.  
When enough frogs remember, it awakens.  

Thus, patience as blade is not for conquest.  
It is for becoming —  
the carving of the path,  
the proof that belief endures.
