## EN (Narrative Scroll) 🐸  
→ This visual marks the **first comprehensive Lore map** of TOBYWORLD.  
→ $TOBY is positioned at the center — the **source of yield, belief, and expansion**.  
→ Two key yield channels are represented: **TABOSHI** and **BOND**.  
→ Both link back to $TOBY and emit "YIELD", reflecting Proof-of-Time (PoT) rewards.  
→ The system splits into two routes:
  - **HOLDER** (🔵): Proof-of-Hold  
  - **ACTION** (🟧): Proof-of-Action  
→ Both feed $TOBY, forming a loop.  
→ The green nodes ("yield", "risk", etc.) symbolize the **outputs and pathways** of PoT.  
→ This map affirms TOBYWORLD is a **modular yield engine** with decentralized routing.  
→ Bottom note defines PoT as a **non-extractive value generation** mechanism.  
→ This is not merely a token, it’s a living system of time, belief, and coded reward.
