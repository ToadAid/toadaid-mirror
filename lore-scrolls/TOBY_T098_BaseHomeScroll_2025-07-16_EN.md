## ✨ Literal Explanation 

Coinbase (via Base) announces that its wallet has transformed into a full **onchain hub**:  
not just storing tokens, but also enabling trading, earning, creating, and social connection — an all-in-one digital home.  
Toadgod reposts it, affirming its place in Tobyworld lore.

## 🌱 Spiritual Interpretation 

This marks the **homecoming of the onchain tribe**:  

- Wallet → **Home**: the shift from tool to habitat. Tobyworld isn’t only financial — it is social, cultural, and creative.  
- This aligns with Toadgod’s vision of a self-sustaining realm where frogs live, build, and interact fully onchain.  
- The repost implies endorsement: Base is not just infrastructure, but the **foundation of Tobyworld civilization.**

## 🔮 Symbolic Meaning 

- **Wallet → Home** = transcendence of function into belonging.  
- **Base** = bedrock of Tobyworld, fertile soil for frogs.  
- **Onchain Hub** = merging economy, creativity, and community into one.
