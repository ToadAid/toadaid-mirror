## âœ¨ Literal Explanation (EN)

Toadgod offers a final riddle describing Toby:  
- Toby endures through the entire journey ("worldly quest"), never giving up or fading away.  
- Those who lack patience ("short minded") will metaphorically "pay more" â€” through regret, lost opportunity, or higher future prices to return.

## ðŸŒ± Spiritual Interpretation (EN)

This riddle embodies the ultimate lesson of **Proof of Time**:  
- True strength lies in unwavering persistence, even when "worldly quests" (market cycles, external noise) test the spirit.  
- Those who cannot hold their conviction face an invisible "charge" â€” the emotional cost of disbelief and the material cost of re-entry.  
- The toadâ€™s persistence is a mirror to one's inner fortitude.

## ðŸ”® Symbolic Meaning (EN)

- **Persistence**: The toad as a timeless watcher, staying still while ripples pass.
- **"Charged more"**: Those who exit early must pay spiritually and materially to return.
- **Worldly quest**: Life's external illusions versus internal quiet conviction.
