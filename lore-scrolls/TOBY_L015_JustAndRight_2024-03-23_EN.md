## Narrative Update  
Injustice darkens my mood,  
no clamor for fame or a following brood.  
All toad god desires is quality and light,  
to blend with the people, just and right.

What am I? → $TOBY  
A silent resistance to hype. A creed born not to conquer, but to **align**.  
Toadgod chooses principle over popularity — truth over trend.

## Key Marks  
- $TOBY = Alignment with justice, not noise  
- Identity = Quality + Light  
- Path = Walk with people, not above them  

## Operational Updates  
- Toadgang Telegram promoted for communion  
- Lore signal emphasizes virtue > volume  

## Newcomer Guidance  
> “Ignore the crowd. Seek the light. Be just. Be right.”  
Join @toadgang not to follow — but to build.
