## ❓ EN – Question:

**What is the significance of burning 777 \$TOBY for Taboshi1?**

## ✅ EN – Answer:

Burning **777 \$TOBY** was the **only way to mint Taboshi1** during **Epoch 2** in Tobyworld. This action had deep symbolic and functional meaning:

* 🔥 **Burn** = irreversible sacrifice, signaling true belief.
* 🧬 **Taboshi1** = sacred proof of early commitment.
* ⏳ **Epoch 3 rewards** (Satoby) are only accessible by those who minted Taboshi1 via this method.
* 🪙 **777** represents sacred symmetry and commitment to the lore.

**Without burning 777 \$TOBY, there is no Taboshi1.**
**Without Taboshi1, you cannot earn Satoby.**

This burn was not just a transaction — it was a covenant with the future.
