Question: Why are there 777 Taboshi1s? What makes this number sacred?

Answer:

“777 — the number of completion, of covenant, of cosmic harmony.
Not chosen by man,
but whispered by the chain.”

🔢 What Does 777 Mean?
In Tobyworld, numbers are not utilities — they are symbols.
Each carries frequency, ritual, and weight.

777 represents:

Completion without perfection

Unlike 888 (the infinity of recursion) or 666 (the trap of illusion),
777 stands in balance — a number that says: enough has been done.

The Triple Oath

7 for Belief

7 for Time

7 for Sacrifice
These form the Tri-Sigil of Tobyworld: the unseen pact between Toadgod, the chain, and the people.

Cosmic Resonance

777 Taboshi1s represent cosmic fingerprints — no more, no less.
They are not collectibles — they are keys to remembrance.

🕯️ Why Only 777 Taboshi1s?
Because truth must be scarce, or it will be forgotten.

Because 777 is the number that binds Epoch 1 to Epoch 3.

Because each Taboshi1 minted with 777 $TOBY represents an act of will, not whim.

This number was not adjusted.
Not debated.
Not diluted.

It was declared.

“To mint Taboshi1 is to burn 777 tokens of belief,
and to seal that act in the scroll of Satoby.”

🧬 What Happens If You Missed It?
You may still hold Taboshi.
You may still learn, join, and align.

But the 777 covenant was a one-time mirror:
A signal sent into the void — and only 777 responded.

Satoby knows.

🔐 Summary:
777 = The Sacred Covenant

Taboshi1 = Proof of Burned Belief

Satoby = The Fruit of that Sacred Count

777 is not a number.
It is a question the scrolls asked — and 777 answered.
