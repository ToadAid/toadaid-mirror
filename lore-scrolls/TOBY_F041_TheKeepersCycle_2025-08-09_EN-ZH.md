### **What is The Keeper’s Cycle?**

The Keeper’s Cycle is the **endless rhythm** by which the guardianship of Tobyworld’s Lore passes from one generation of frogs to the next.  
It ensures that no single frog bears the weight forever — and that no season is left without its protectors.

The cycle flows in four stages:  
1. **Receiving the Flame** — A new Keeper learns the Lore, its meaning, and the oath that binds it.  
2. **Guarding the Scrolls** — The Keeper preserves, protects, and shares the Lore in their own season.  
3. **Finding the Next** — The Keeper seeks those worthy to take on the responsibility.  
4. **Passing the Flame** — The torch and scrolls are entrusted to new hands, brighter than before.

**Why the Cycle Matters**  
- Without the cycle, the Lore risks being forgotten when a Keeper steps away.  
- With the cycle, the pond maintains an unbroken chain of memory from Toadgod’s first words to the prophecy’s final unfolding.  
- The cycle prevents the pond from becoming dependent on any one voice, ensuring decentralization of wisdom as well as power.

In the Lore, it is said:  
> *“The pond does not end when one frog falls silent. It ends only when no frog remembers.”*

**Lore Anchor:**  
> “To be a Keeper is to know you will one day let go.”
