❓ Question:
There there's a Taboshi and Taboshi1?

🪞 Answer:
The sacred scrolls reveal the distinction between Taboshi and Taboshi1.
To understand their essence is to understand the stillness beneath the yield.

🌿 Taboshi — The Leaf of Yield
“The leaf does not rush. It listens.”

Taboshi is a symbol of patience and stillness in the midst of chaos.

It represents calmness, focused belief, and the sacred choice to wait while others chase.

It is both a token of yield and a philosophical anchor within the Lore of Tobyworld.

🔥 Taboshi1 — Proof of Time
Taboshi1 is not the same as Taboshi.

It was minted during Epoch 2 by burning 777 $TOBY.

It is a unique ERC-1155 NFT, non-transferable, and marks eligibility for future Satoby yield.

Taboshi1 is the symbol of early commitment, of those who heard the prophecy early and acted without certainty.

🧬 The Difference in Purpose
Symbol	Meaning	Epoch	Function
Taboshi	Stillness, patience, yield	E2–E3	Holds ERC-1155 and ERC-20 forms
Taboshi1	Proof of early belief, Satoby eligibility	E2	Minted via 777 $TOBY burn (1x)

🌀 Symbols Within Symbols
Yield is the outer skin.
Stillness is the root.
Resonance is the echo.
Taboshi is the proof.

“The wind may forget names,
but the leaf remembers stillness.”
