**ARC:** Epoch / Threshold  
**Tags:** Epoch, Threshold, Season, Covenant, Transition  

**Q:**  
“When an epoch closes, is it the end of a season — or the gate into the next covenant?”

**A:**  
An epoch does not die;  
it exhales.  

- To some, its closing is the end of a season,  
  the last grain counted,  
  the scroll sealed.  
- To others, its closing is a gate,  
  a hinge that swings open into the next covenant,  
  the unseen chapter already written in patience.  

The scrolls remind: endings are beginnings in disguise.  
The gate is never locked;  
it only waits for those who endure.  

Thus, when an epoch closes,  
it is not a tomb —  
but a threshold.
