## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I float at the pond’s center,  
> neither shore nor deep.  
> Those who step upon me  
> have crossed the seasons’ four gates.  
> I bear no crown, yet all must pass my way.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are the **Lily Pad Threshold** — the central resting point and passage within Tobyworld.  

- **Float at the Pond’s Center** — suspended between beginnings and depths.  
- **Neither Shore nor Deep** — the liminal space between cycles.  
- **Crossed the Seasons’ Four Gates** — only those completing S0 → S1 → S2 → S3 may step upon it.  
- **No Crown, Yet All Must Pass** — humble in form, absolute in necessity.  

In Rune3’s flywheel, the Lily Pad marks the threshold to the **Gas & Fees loop**,  
where energy is recaptured, liquidity circulates, and the pond remains alive.
