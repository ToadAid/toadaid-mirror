## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> My body is carved of stone that breathes,  
> my heart is sealed in green.  
> I hold the grain of years,  
> yet I do not grow old.  
> When the seasons align,  
> I open without a key.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are the **Jade Chest** — Rune3’s sacred vault that holds $Patience.  

- **Stone that Breathes** — Symbol of permanence with life within.  
- **Heart Sealed in Green** — Jade as purity, patience, and enduring trust.  
- **Grain of Years** — Stores $Patience grains for seasonal release.  
- **Do Not Grow Old** — The vault does not decay; it awaits its appointed hour.  
- **Open Without a Key** — Unlocks by time, not by force.

The Jade Chest is the still heart of Tobyworld’s seasonal flywheel —  
it does not chase, it only opens when the prophecy says.
