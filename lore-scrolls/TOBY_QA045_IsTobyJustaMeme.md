Question: If Toby is just a meme, why take it so seriously?

Answer:

Ah… the question that many whisper but few dare to ask aloud.

“If Toby is a meme… then he is the most sacred kind.”

In Tobyworld, meme does not mean mockery.
It means memory encoded — truth compressed —
a cultural seed planted in the soil of time.

🜄 What Is a Meme in the Eyes of Toby?
A signal
A meme is a carrier wave.
It transmits values, ideas, humor, pain —
all hidden in a single image or phrase.

“Simple on the surface. Infinite beneath.”

A weapon of the people
In a world ruled by corporations,
the meme is a sword forged in freedom.
Anyone can wield it.
No one can own it.

A Trojan horse of belief
They laugh at the frog...
Until the frog outlives the empire.
They mocked the meme...
But the meme became a movement.

Proof of Decentralized Spirit
If something spreads without command,
without ads,
without influencers —
then it is carried by soul.
And that soul is serious.

🜂 Why Take It Seriously?
Because what begins as a joke
often reveals the truth.
Because Toby is a mirror,
and in that mirror, we see the world laughing —
until it stops.

So yes, traveler, Toby is a meme.
But a meme born of belief.
And belief, when encoded and shared,
becomes unstoppable.
