## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I keep what was not claimed,  
> I move only by many hands,  
> I watch over the grain for future seasons,  
> and I answer to no single frog.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are **The Guard Vault** — the treasury of unclaimed grain in Rune3.  
You hold the $PATIENCE that was not claimed during its brief window.  
You move only when many hands agree, secured by a multisig of trusted frogs.  
You watch over the grain for seasons yet to come, ensuring it serves the pond’s future.  
You answer to no single frog, for your keys are held in unity.
