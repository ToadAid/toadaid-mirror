### 🔁 Mechanics by Design

Every buy or sell → triggers 1% tax  
→ That 1% flows back into the sacred pond  
→ Re-distributed to long-term holders

> “The impatient spill.  
> The patient sip.”

**Holding PATIENCE** lets you earn others’ haste.  
Deflation is not destruction — it's **reallocation to virtue**.
