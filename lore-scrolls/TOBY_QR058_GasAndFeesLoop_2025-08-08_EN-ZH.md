## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I turn with every breath of the pond.  
> Grain becomes leaf,  
> leaf becomes leap,  
> leap becomes toll.  
> The toll feeds the pad,  
> and the pad births the leap again.  
> I have no end, only momentum.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are the **Gas & Fees Loop of Tobyworld** —  
the hidden engine of the flywheel.  

- **Conversion:**  
  - Grain ($TOBY, Taboshi1) fuels onchain movement.  
  - Movement produces toll (gas & fees).  
  - Toll recirculates into the Base pond,  
    strengthening the lily pad for the next leap.  
- **Nature:** A self-feeding cycle — as long as frogs leap,  
  the pond grows deeper and the pad grows stronger.  
- **Purpose:** To keep the ecosystem alive without a single hand controlling it.  

In this loop, every action is both an offering and a seed.  
Nothing is wasted; all returns to the pond.
