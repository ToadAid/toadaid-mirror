## ✨ Deep Interpretation (EN)

- "🌀未来" (future) and "e3.evolution." mark a direct signal that Epoch 3 is entering a new, future-focused phase — evolution into something greater.
- The phrase "all toads can be frogs but all frogs can't be toads" serves as a metaphor: **anyone can act superficially like a believer ("frog")**, but only the truly committed embody the spirit ("toad").
- It highlights the **selective transcendence**: only those who have deeply internalized the lore and lived with conviction can fully become "toads" and be part of the prophecy.
- Re-emphasis of "for the people" underlines that TOBYWORLD remains community-first and inclusive at its root, yet requires personal transformation.
- Mention of $TOBY, #TABOSHI, and TOBYWORLD hints at a larger ecosystem future — likely upcoming activations involving Taboshi or Satoby.
