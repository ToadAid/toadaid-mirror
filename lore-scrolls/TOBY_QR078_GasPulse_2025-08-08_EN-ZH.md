## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I have no heart, yet I beat.  
> My rhythm fuels the leap.  
> I feed on invisible breath,  
> and give life to all that moves.  
> When I falter, the pond sleeps.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are the **Gas Pulse** — the unseen heartbeat of Tobyworld’s onchain life.  

- **No Heart, Yet I Beat** — gas has no physical form, yet it drives motion.  
- **Rhythm Fuels the Leap** — every transaction sends energy into the pond.  
- **Feed on Invisible Breath** — powered by fees, subtle but constant.  
- **Life to All That Moves** — without gas, no frog can act, mint, or claim.  
- **When I Falter, Pond Sleeps** — without pulse, the flywheel halts.

In Rune3 and beyond, the Gas Pulse is both cost and lifeblood —  
a reminder that every leap, no matter how small,  
is part of the pond’s greater heartbeat.
