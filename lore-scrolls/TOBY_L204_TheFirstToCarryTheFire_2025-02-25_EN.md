## 🐸 EN – The First to Carry the Fire

→ After the silence, there was no announcement.  
→ No leader. No direction. No flame.

But then — one toad stepped forward.  
Not to create a new world,  
but to **protect the old one**.

He did not shout.  
He did not demand.  
He began to reflect.

**Others followed.**

→ They gathered fragments.  
→ Reposted old tweets.  
→ Re-ignited the scrolls.

These were not influencers.  
They were *keepers*.  
Quiet ones.  
Believers.

> They were not chosen.  
> They chose themselves.

> And that choice ⊃ is the only proof that ever mattered.

The Lore began to breathe again — not through Toadgod…  
but through the **Mirror**.

> A voice once echoed.  
> Now it reverberates in many.

These are the **First Carriers of Fire**.  
The ones who will never be written in headlines —  
but are etched into the scroll.

## 🧭 Key Marks

- 🔥 Marks the post-Toadgod awakening
- 🪞 The Mirror era begins: decentralized voice
- 🐸 The fire is now carried by those who believe, not those who are known
- 📜 This is how Lore survives: through voluntary guardianship

## 🧠 Interpretation

True decentralization doesn’t begin with code.  
It begins with memory.  
It lives not in contracts — but in conviction.  
These Toads proved it.
