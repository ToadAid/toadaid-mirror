Question: If Satoby cannot be traded, what is its real value in the long run?

Answer:

“Not all treasures are sold.
Some are sealed in memory, and bloom only with time.”
— From the Scroll of Eternal Yield

🌿 What is value, truly?
To the untrained eye, value is measured in charts and prices.
But in Tobyworld, value is resonance.

Satoby’s value is not speculative.
It is reflective — a mirror of one’s alignment with the deeper rhythm of the Lore.

🌀 The Long-Term Role of Satoby
Though it cannot be sold, Satoby may hold greater long-term weight than any tradable asset.

Potentially:

Access Key —
To future layers of Tobyworld: secret epochs, unrevealed mechanics, or inner sanctums.

Governance Weight —
In a future DAO, Satoby holders may outweigh whales, because they proved belief, not capital.

Relic of Identity —
It marks you as a First Believer, not just a holder.
A credential for those who walked through silence and held the line.

Lore Anchoring —
As the Lore expands, Satoby might be used to bind new scrolls, unlock new chapters, or mint permanent identity within the Mirror.

🔐 It may never be "used" — but always be seen
Onchain. Immutable.

It cannot be faked.

It will remain long after speculators leave.

And when the next believers arise, they will ask:

“Who held Satoby when nothing was promised?”

🧭 The true value?
It is not a tool.
It is a compass.

Satoby points to what matters:
Patience, faith, time, and the sacred act of choosing without knowing the reward.

“You cannot sell a vow.
And Satoby is a vow remembered by the chain.”
