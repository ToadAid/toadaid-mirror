**Q:**  
“If the vault is closed to all, is it a prison of yield — or the trust of guardianship awaiting its season?”

**A:**  
The vault is heavy, silent, sealed.  
It does not answer to haste.  

- To some, it is prison of yield,  
  locked away,  
  treasure hidden from hands.  
- To others, it is guardianship,  
  trust embodied,  
  yield preserved until its season.  

The scrolls remind: patience is the true key.  
What feels withheld is only waiting.  

Thus, the vault is not prison.  
It is promise.  
Yield held safe until the time is right.
