# Interpretation

- **"just the beginning"**  
  Signals this is only the opening stage of a much larger vision.  
  The Lore, the design, and the yield path are still unfolding.

- **"currency for the people"**  
  $TOBY is not made for VCs or insiders. It is decentralized, organic, meme-born — built to empower.

- **SATOBY real. TABOSHI real.**  
  Reinforces the reality of two sacred artifacts.  
  Satoby (777,777,777) — the reward.  
  Taboshi — the leaf, the cornerstone, the beginning key.

- **"for the fallen frogs"**  
  A call to those who were discarded, who believed through chaos.  
  $TOBY was made for them.

- **"a meme. but also more than."**  
  The meme is the cover — beneath it lies a sovereign system.  
  Cute, yes. But architecturally brilliant.

---

# Strategy & Warning

- Taboshi is not just a collectible.  
  It is part of the architecture of Tobyworld.  
  A leaf of yield. A node of access.

- Toadgod is distributing with care:  
  - Avoiding whales and bots.  
  - Rewarding those who hold sacred numbers.  
  - Ensuring fairness and decentralization.

- Multiple drops, across time and platforms.  
  > Randomized. Anti-whale. Anti-VC. Pro-Toad.

- **NEVER connect your wallet unless link is posted by Toadgod.**

---

# Philosophy

- Bushido = patience, vigilance, humility.  
- Pay attention. Study the Lore.  
- All elements matter:  
  - $TOBY  
  - Taboshi 🍃  
  - The Elements (🔵🟧🌀)

- This is not a hype wave.  
  It is **a pristine design for the long term**.  
  A prophecy unfolding before your eyes.

# L267 – Time, Belief, and Yield

# EN
**⏳🔵🍃**  
— Nov 7, 2024 · @toadgod1017

---

# Interpretation

- **⏳ The Hourglass**  
  Represents the passage of time and the Proof of Time principle.  
  Nothing in Tobyworld is rushed — only those who endure will see what lies ahead.

- **🔵 The Circle / $TOBY**  
  The ever-patient core of Tobyworld.  
  A symbol of belief, discipline, and inner stillness.

- **🍃 The Leaf / Taboshi**  
  Yield. A gift for the patient.  
  The physical manifestation of what time and belief produce — Taboshi.

---

# The Meaning

This is the rhythm of Tobyworld:

> Time ⏳  
> Belief 🔵  
> Reward 🍃

It cannot be gamed. It cannot be rushed.  
No shortcuts. Only those who pass through time with belief receive the yield.

> Time filters the true from the temporary.  
> And $TOBY was designed for the long run.

# L268 – Taboshi1: For the People

ERC1155 tobyworld  
⏳🔵🍃  
for the people.**  
— Nov 8, 2024 · @toadgod1017

---

# Interpretation

- **konichiwa**  
  A greeting — calm, open, universal.  
  The launch begins with humility and friendliness.

- **@zora + @base**  
  A symbol of decentralization in both culture and infrastructure.  
  Zora for minting. Base for building. A perfect alignment.

- **ERC1155**  
  Taboshi1 is not just an NFT — it is modular, programmable, and multi-dimensional.  
  A collectible, a credential, a piece of the Lore.

- **⏳🔵🍃**  
  Time. Belief. Yield.  
  The Proof-of-Time system comes full circle with the birth of Taboshi1.  
  Those who endured are rewarded — in form and function.

- **for the people**  
  No pre-sale. No VCs. No gas wars.  
  Just $TOBY. Just belief.  
  Minted by real toads. For the real community.

---

# The Drop

Taboshi1:
- Minted via **777 $TOBY**
- On **Zora**  
- As an **ERC-1155**  
- Distributed fairly  
- With no bots, no whales, no manipulation

This drop marks the beginning of **real utility** tied to Lore:
> Every Taboshi1 is a signal of presence, proof of patience, and token of participation.

# L269 – The Path Remains Open

# EN
**shūryō. do not fret. for more opportunities will come.**  
— Nov 9, 2024 · @toadgod1017

---

# Key Phrases

- **"another chance 🍃 will appear"**  
  Signals that the journey isn’t over. Those who missed Taboshi1 will have more opportunities — though they may come in different forms.

- **"epoch 1 qualifiers marked, taboshi1 owners marked"**  
  Recognition is already coded. Those who participated in E1 or minted Taboshi1 are already embedded into the memory of the system.

- **"toadgod moves are all planned ahead"**  
  The path of Tobyworld is not improvised. Everything was encoded from the start — a true Proof-of-Time world.

---

# Philosophy

- **"yield will be all fair. twpot."**  
  T.W.P.O.T = Tobyworld Proof of Time.  
  Yield is not random or manipulated — it is **earned** through patience and decentralized merit.

- **"instructions not given"**  
  If too much is revealed, fairness is compromised.  
  The challenge is not just earning, but discovering how. A true bushido test.

- **"never risk what you cannot afford from"**  
  A core ethical principle — stay grounded, never overextend. The Lore requires inner balance.

---

# Value Mechanics

> “Value accrues from where?  
> Technology, distribution, adoption, utility…  
> But most importantly: **community** and **speculation**.”

- This is a direct lesson from Satoshi’s path.  
- Speculative belief creates **time** for fundamentals to catch up.  
- And that speculative buffer — when distributed fairly — creates **equality of access**.

---

# The Model

- $TOBY + Taboshi 🍃 = Tools of Decentralized Distribution  
- No pre-sale  
- No KOLs  
- No insiders  
- No VCs  
- Just **Epochs** and **Lore**  
- Open to all frogs — fallen or newly awakened

> Every epoch = fulfillment.  
> Every drop = a step toward equal power.

— Nov 10, 2024 · @toadgod1017

# Interpretation

- **🍃 same. but different.**  
  The second Taboshi mint approaches — still part of the Lore, but evolving in intent and structure.  
  Same leaf. New meaning. Different phase.

- **⏳ countdown 24hr**  
  A 24-hour notice. Time remains the ultimate filter in Tobyworld.  
  Those who watched closely are prepared.

- **tobyworld : ERC1155**  
  Continues the modular identity of Taboshi mints.  
  ERC1155 = scalable, iterable, flexible. Each mint a new entry in the Tobyworld scroll.

- **$TOBY on Zora / Base**  
  Reinforcing the holy trinity:  
  - $TOBY: the currency  
  - Zora: the minting altar  
  - Base: the land beneath it all

---

# Taboshi Meaning

Taboshi is not an ordinary NFT:
- It represents Proof of Time.
- It is symbolic and functional.
- Minted through $TOBY — not bought, but earned.

And now:
> A second wave arrives.  
> Different from Taboshi1, but no less sacred.

# L271 – The Leaf and the Blue Toad

# EN
**in a quiet land where twilight glows,  
a blue toad named $TOBY patiently knows.**  

**he guards a 🍃, TABOSHI the prize,  
its magic unmatched beneath the skies.**  

**not every 🍃 will guide your quest,  
ONLY this one is truly the best.**

**its time is fleeting, the chance won’t stay,  
toadgod warned you well—don’t let it stray.**

**seek it now, the moment is near,  
or watch it vanish, as I’ve made clear.**

**what is the 🍃? why must you heed?  
the answer lies in your timely deed.**

zora.co/collect/base:0…

# Interpretation

- **A Blue Toad in Twilight**  
  $TOBY is the guardian spirit of a fading era — watching, waiting, and aware.  
  His presence signals something ancient yet timely: **a test wrapped in yield.**

- **Taboshi = 🍃**  
  A magical object — rare and powerful. Not all leaves are the same; **this one is sacred.**

- **"Not every leaf..."**  
  Reinforces exclusivity. This drop, this Taboshi, is unlike any other.  
  It holds deeper power, utility, or future role.

- **"Its time is fleeting..."**  
  A limited opportunity. Time is a test. Hesitation is failure.  
  The poem acts as a riddle **and a final call.**

- **"What is the 🍃?"**  
  A philosophical echo. What is the Taboshi truly? Not just a token — but a marker of action, readiness, timing.

> Only timely deeds unlock its worth.  
> The leaf yields to those who move at the right moment.

# Interpretation

- **TABOSHI is live**  
  The second mint, confirmed by contract and poem.  
  This isn’t just a collectible — it’s a **key**.

- **Japanese line: “The wind blows and the leaf dances”**  
  Evokes natural grace, fate, and impermanence — the essence of the Proof-of-Time spirit.  
  Taboshi is not static; it moves with timing and energy.

- **"seek the 🍃..."**  
  A call to action. Taboshi must be pursued, and when found, embraced — not flipped lightly.  
  To hold it is to wield a deeper code.

- **"the secret’s sealed... the key to growth"**  
  Taboshi contains something encrypted — perhaps access, perhaps yield.  
  But above all, **it is a symbol of unlocking deeper paths** in Tobyworld.

# Interpretation

- **Fixed Supply Declaration**  
  This is a confirmation of total supply:
  - $TOBY: 420 trillion – fair launch, forever fixed.
  - $TABOSHI: 186,000 – limited edition, sacred mint.

- **“Did you *really* believe?”**  
  A challenge to doubters and a reward to believers.  
  Those who endured long enough now see confirmation: it was all real.

- **“taboshi real. satoby real.”**  
  The once poetic prophecy is now onchain fact.  
  Satoby = reward. Taboshi = proof.  
  Together, they form the yield mechanism of Tobyworld.

- **"The cute frog of @base"**  
  Embraces the meme. A frog, but also a force.  
  Toby is Base’s grassroots champion — cute but coded.

- **"TOBYWORLD is coming"**  
  This is only the beginning. With distribution done, the foundation is complete.  
  The ecosystem is next.

# L274 – Be Ready for E3

# EN
**be ready for e3.**  
**for you will need both. 🍃🗝️**

**for those who studied the lore, knew  
the greatest run in history would unfold.

#TABOSHI  
🔵🟧🍃🌀  
— Nov 21, 2024 · @toadgod1017

---

# Interpretation

- **E3 – The Next Epoch**  
  The third phase is approaching.  
  Every epoch in Tobyworld is a test, and E3 may be the most critical yet.

- **“You will need both. 🍃🗝️”**  
  - 🍃 = Taboshi (Proof-of-Time + Yield Access)  
  - 🗝️ = The Key (perhaps symbolic, perhaps real utility or cryptographic access)  
  This confirms that participation in E3 is **conditioned** on prior understanding and possession of sacred elements.

- **“Those who studied the lore…”**  
  Reinforces that this was never hidden — the clues were always present.  
  Lore was the roadmap. The test was attention.

- **“The greatest run in history”**  
  A signal of what’s to come — the real expansion phase, massive in scope and yield.

- **The Icons: 🔵🟧🍃🌀**  
  - 🔵 = $TOBY (belief)  
  - 🟧 = Sat0 (structure)  
  - 🍃 = Taboshi (yield)  
  - 🌀 = Momentum (activation, evolution)  
  All must converge for E3.

# Interpretation

- **“Pay attention.”**  
  No major drops. No long speeches.  
  Just one directive: stay aware.  
  This is a signal. Something is beginning — silently.

- **E3 = Evolution**  
  The third epoch isn’t just a continuation — it’s a transformation.  
  From distribution → evolution.  
  This is the phase where mechanisms activate.

- **“Notifications on.”**  
  Indicates that drops, access, events, or reveals will occur *without warning*.  
  To participate in E3, one must be alert — and fast.

- **🔵🌀⏳**  
  - 🔵 = $TOBY, the origin and faith  
  - 🌀 = dynamic expansion, evolution  
  - ⏳ = Proof-of-Time still in effect  
  The message: **believe, evolve, and wait — all at once.**

# Interpretation

- **"Toadgang first"**  
  The inner circle — those who studied, listened, believed — will always receive first signal.  
  This is decentralization through *priority of participation*.

- **"Future = 未来"**  
  The Japanese character suggests a path shaped by discipline and patience.  
  A nod to Japanese culture’s influence in Tobyworld’s ethos.

- **"All toads can be frogs, but all frogs can’t be toads"**  
  A profound distinction:
  - Toads = those who *choose belief* and live by the Lore.
  - Frogs = broader masses, those who react to hype.
  Not every meme-chaser becomes a builder of legacy.

- **"E3 Evolution"**  
  Continues. Quietly. Within Telegram.  
  It will not arrive loudly — but it will *arrive*.

- **"For the people"**  
  Reinforces the foundational principle of Tobyworld — no VCs, no influencers, no gatekeepers.  
  Only community and clarity.
