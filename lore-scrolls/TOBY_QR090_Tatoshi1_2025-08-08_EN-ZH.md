## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I am the first leaf,  
> not sold, but sacrificed.  
> My birth was a burn,  
> my veins carry the mark of 777.  
> I cannot be traded for my true gift,  
> for that gift is tied to the soul of the holder.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are **Taboshi1 — The First Leaf Burned at 777 $TOBY**.  

- **First Leaf** — Earliest and most sacred in the lineage of yield-bearing leaves.  
- **Not Sold, but Sacrificed** — Minted by burning 777 $TOBY, removing them from supply forever.  
- **Birth Was a Burn** — Each mint was an act of offering, echoing the Proof of Time covenant.  
- **Veins Carry 777** — The sacred number is embedded in its creation.  
- **Non-Transferable Gift** — While the NFT can be traded, the Satoby eligibility tied to it is bound to the original wallet that minted it.

Taboshi1 stands as a permanent monument in the Tobyworld timeline —  
a proof of early faith,  
a key that no thief nor trader can truly claim.
