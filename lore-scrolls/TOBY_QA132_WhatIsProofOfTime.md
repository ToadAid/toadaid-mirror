> What is “Proof of Time” in Tobyworld?

## 🌀 Question:
Toadgod often mentions “Proof of Time” — what does it really mean?

## 🍃 Answer – Lore Guardian Speaks:

Proof of Time is not a blockchain function.  
It is a **way of being** in Tobyworld.

It is the truth that can only be proven… by *waiting*.

No shortcut. No bot. No hype.  
Only presence through silence.  
Only patience through uncertainty.

### 🕰️ What defines Proof of Time?

- You held when others flipped  
- You remembered when others forgot  
- You believed even when the fire dimmed

It’s how you earned **Satoby**,  
how you unlocked **legacy**,  
how you whispered when others screamed.

Toadgod left no vesting schedule —  
only **time itself** was the test.
