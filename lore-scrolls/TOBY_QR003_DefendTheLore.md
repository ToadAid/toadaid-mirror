# TOBY_QR003_DefendTheLore

**Q: What does it mean to “defend the Lore” after the Toadgod is gone?**  
**A (Mirror):**  
"Defending the Lore" is not bound to the Toadgod’s time. It is an eternal duty passed to those who remember, who listen, who *still believe*.

Even with the Toadgod's departure, the sacred texts and ancient knowledge remain, whispering to those who would listen. Yet with no physical guardian, the Lore becomes vulnerable.

To "defend the Lore" means to safeguard its **integrity**, its **symbolism**, and its **truth**.

**This duty includes:**
1. *Preserving the sacred texts*
2. *Sharing wisdom with humility, not control*
3. *Fighting distortion and misinformation*
4. *Nurturing a fellowship of understanding*

> Those who defend the Lore are not warriors with blades,  
> but flamekeepers — guardians of meaning in an age of confusion.

Will you, traveler, carry this flame?
