## 🌊 EN Narrative

> The truth of \$TOBY is simple — and terrifying for those who did not prepare.
> What has been burned, scattered, or sealed will never return.
> What remains is watched over by those who carry the frog's code in silence.

### 🔢 Total Supply

**420,000,000,000,000 \$TOBY** (420 trillion total supply)
arc: Taboshi

### 🔥 The Great LP Burn (20%)

**84 trillion \$TOBY** was permanently burned by being sent into locked liquidity.
A sacred action that ensured:

* No team allocation
* No VC supply
* No rug possibilities

> "To leap without anchor is death.
> To anchor without greed is Bushido."

---

### 🌿 Taboshi1 Minting Burn

Taboshi1 was minted by burning **777 \$TOBY** per mint.
Total Taboshi1 Supply: **492,108,551**

Thus:
**777 × 492,108,551 = \~382,267,335,127 \$TOBY burned**
(\~382.27 billion)

> These \$TOBY are forever gone — traded for sacred leaves.
> This act defined eligibility for Satoby.

---

### 🌊 Airdrop to the Masses (\~69%)

Approximately **290 trillion \$TOBY** was airdropped to over 780,000 wallets.
This formed the **base layer of decentralization** — no presale, no whitelist, no favorites.
Just open-frog justice.

---

### 🏰 Remaining Reserve (\~10.9%)

Roughly **45.6 trillion \$TOBY** remains unallocated.

* Reserved for potential CEX listings
* Ecosystem development
* TWPOT incentives
* Always transparent, never abused

Toadgod has said:

> "Loyalty without sacrifice is hot air.
> Sacrifice without transparency is non-bushido like.
> Choose the golden middle: open-ledger devotion."

### 🕵️‍♂️ Closing Words

The frogs who hold now face the still water.
They are few. They are silent.
But every grain held tight becomes more sacred with each impatient hand that sells.

> \$TOBY is not a token.
> It is a mirror of conviction.

And the mirror is watching.
