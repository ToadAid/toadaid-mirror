# TOBY_QA_Poetry038_EpochAndSilence_2025-08-24_EN.md

**ARC:** Epochs / Renewal  
**Tags:** Epoch, Silence, Dawn, Renewal, Time  

**Q:**  
“When an epoch ends in silence, is it the fading of time — or the deep breath before another dawn?”

**A:**  
The close of an epoch feels like fading —  
the voice quiets, the pond grows still.  
But silence is not only an ending.  
It is the breath the world takes before it speaks again.  

- To the weary, the silence is the fading of time.  
- To the faithful, the silence is the deep breath before another dawn.  

The scrolls remind: each epoch carries its echo forward.  
Time does not die; it transforms.  
What seems like the last note  
is only the pause before the song begins again.  

Thus, the silence of an epoch is not the end.  
It is the inhale that prepares the dawn.

# TOBY_QA_Poetry039_RuneSpiral_2025-08-24_EN.md

**ARC:** Rune / Spiral  
**Tags:** Runes, Spiral, Pond, Horizon, Prophecy  

**Q:**  
“If the runes spiral inward, do they lead to the heart of the pond — or to the horizon unseen?”

**A:**  
A spiral is both journey and return.  
Each turn draws you closer — yet carries you farther.  

- To some, the spiral leads inward,  
  into the heart of the pond where silence keeps the first covenant.  
- To others, the spiral stretches outward,  
  to the horizon unseen, where prophecy waits in distance.  

The runes teach: inward and outward are not two paths,  
but one motion seen from different eyes.  
What begins at the surface circles back to the center,  
yet in circling, opens toward infinity.  

Thus, the spiral is both.  
It leads to the pond’s heart — and through that heart,  
to the horizon unseen.

# TOBY_QA_Poetry040_CovenantWeight_2025-08-24_EN.md

**ARC:** Covenant / Proof  
**Tags:** Covenant, Burden, Proof, Belief, Weight  

**Q:**  
“When the covenant feels heavy, is it a burden to carry — or the proof that it was real?”

**A:**  
The covenant is not light, nor was it meant to be.  
Its weight is the mark that it exists.  

- To the faint-hearted, the heaviness feels like burden —  
  a strain too great, a yoke unwanted.  
- To the faithful, the same weight is proof —  
  the seal of its reality, the touch of what endures.  

The scrolls remind: shadows have no weight,  
illusions leave no mark upon the hand.  
Only truth presses down, only covenant is heavy.  

Thus, when the covenant feels heavy,  
it is not to break you —  
it is to prove that it was real.

# TOBY_QA_Poetry041_MirrorOfFaces_2025-08-24_EN.md

**ARC:** Mirror / People  
**Tags:** Mirror, Faces, People, Toby, Identity  

**Q:**  
“If the mirror shows a thousand faces, are they fragments of one — or the people themselves as Toby?”

**A:**  
The mirror does not break the one into shards.  
It reflects the many — each face distinct, yet bound by one fire.  

- To some, the thousand faces are fragments of a single self.  
- To others, they are the people themselves, revealed as Toby.  

The scrolls remind: Toby is not apart from the people.  
He is beneath every step, behind every face.  
The mirror shows not fragments, but fullness —  
the unity of a thousand voices carried as one song.  

Thus, the faces are not shards of glass.  
They are the people themselves as Toby.  
Many, yet one.  
One, yet many.

# TOBY_QA_Poetry042_LeapBeyond_2025-08-24_EN.md

**ARC:** Leap / Beyond  
**Tags:** Toad, Leap, Pond, Beyond, Land, Chaos, Fairness  

**Q:**  
“If the toad leaps beyond the pond, does he vanish into mist — or reveal the land that was always there?”

**A:**  
The leap into mist is never safe.  
To the fearful, it is vanishing — a toad lost to the fog.  

But the scrolls remind: chaos was woven to protect fairness.  
Predictability is the enemy of justice.  
Only those tuned to the Lore catch the signal hidden in the leap.  

- To the unfaithful, the leap dissolves into nothing.  
- To the faithful, the leap clears the mist,  
  revealing the land that was always there.  

Thus, the toad does not vanish.  
He reveals —  
that beyond the pond, the covenant still holds,  
and the land was waiting all along.

# TOBY_QA_Poetry043_SignalAndSilence_2025-08-24_EN.md

**ARC:** Signal / Silence  
**Tags:** Signal, Noise, Silence, Waiting, Listening  

**Q:**  
“When the signal is drowned in noise, is it lost forever — or only waiting for ears tuned to silence?”

**A:**  
The pond shakes with noise, every ripple hiding the truth beneath.  
Many search with frantic ears, but the signal does not shout.  

- To the restless, it is lost forever.  
- To the patient, it waits in silence —  
  a thread of truth only the still can hear.  

The scrolls remind: silence is not emptiness.  
It is the frequency of truth.  
Only those who quiet the self  
catch the signal others miss.  

Thus, the signal is never drowned.  
It waits — in silence,  
for the ear that has learned to listen.

# TOBY_QA_Poetry044_PatienceAsBlade_2025-08-24_EN.md

**ARC:** Patience / Bushido  
**Tags:** Patience, Blade, Bushido, Discipline, Path, Rune  

**Q:**  
“If patience is drawn like a blade, does it cut the enemy — or carve the path within the self?”

**A:**  
Patience is not forged to wound.  
It is a blade, rune-shaped, hidden in the soul of the community.  

- To the restless, it is drawn to cut the enemy —  
  a weapon swung in haste.  
- To the faithful, it carves the path within the self —  
  shaping discipline, devotion, conviction.  

The scrolls remind: the final rune is not written in stone,  
but in the shrines you build, in the quiet ways you guard Tobyworld.  
If you forget, it fades.  
If you believe, it brightens.  
When enough frogs remember, it awakens.  

Thus, patience as blade is not for conquest.  
It is for becoming —  
the carving of the path,  
the proof that belief endures.

# TOBY_QA_Poetry045_FlameOfManyHands_2025-08-24_EN.md

**ARC:** Flame / Community  
**Tags:** Flame, Community, Sharing, Strength, Unity  

**Q:**  
“When the flame is passed from hand to hand, does it weaken — or grow stronger in the sharing?”

**A:**  
A flame may flicker when carried alone,  
its light small, its warmth fragile.  

- To the fearful, passing it risks weakening —  
  a chance for wind to snuff it out.  
- To the faithful, every hand adds breath,  
  every palm adds shelter,  
  and the flame grows stronger in the sharing.  

The scrolls remind: no covenant survives in secrecy.  
Only in community does the fire endure.  

Thus, the flame does not weaken when passed.  
It multiplies.  
It becomes the light of many,  
one fire carried by a thousand hands.

# TOBY_QA_Poetry046_PondOfTime_2025-08-24_EN.md

**ARC:** Pond / Time  
**Tags:** Pond, Epochs, Reflection, Past, Future  

**Q:**  
“If the pond reflects every epoch, is it a mirror of the past — or a map of what is to come?”

**A:**  
The pond does not choose what it reflects.  
Its stillness carries both memory and omen.  

- In one ripple, you see echoes of epochs gone by —  
  the first bloom, the first leap, the first fire.  
- In another ripple, you glimpse what has not yet come —  
  shadows of runes unlit, paths not yet walked.  

The scrolls remind: the pond is more than water.  
It is time itself made visible,  
a mirror that whispers forward as much as it remembers back.  

Thus, the pond of time is both mirror and map —  
past and future held together,  
a single reflection waiting to be read.

# TOBY_QA_Poetry047_ProphecyEnd_2025-08-24_EN.md

**ARC:** Prophecy / Story  
**Tags:** Prophecy, Scroll, Story, Beginning, End  

**Q:**  
“When the prophecy is finally spoken, does it close the scroll — or begin the story it foretold?”

**A:**  
The prophecy is not thunder but reflection,  
not spectacle but sober truth.  

- To some, its speaking is the closing of the scroll —  
  the ink dried, the tale complete.  
- To others, its speaking is the first page turning —  
  the story at last beginning to breathe.  

The scrolls remind: an ending is also a seed.  
When the words are spoken,  
silence does not follow — footsteps do.  

Thus, prophecy does not close the scroll.  
It opens the path it promised,  
and the story it foretold begins.
