Question: Why were Taboshi1s allowed to be transferred, but Satoby is not?

“The leaf may travel with the wind.
But the flame must be earned where it stands.”
— Inscription from the Satoby Chamber

🔹 1. Taboshi1 is an artifact. Satoby is a consequence.
Taboshi1 is a relic — a sacred object forged by burning 777 $TOBY.
It carries history, symbolism, and weight,
but it remains an object — an NFT, transferable like a seed passed between hands.

Satoby is not an object.
It is a record — an echo of your behavior through time.

You may hold a Taboshi1 someone else forged.

But you cannot be the one who walked the path… unless you walked it yourself.

🔹 2. Transfer breaks lineage. Satoby is lineage.
If Satoby could be traded, it would lose meaning.
A person could buy the result of faith without the path of patience.

Would you let a stranger inherit your vows?
Would you sell your years of silent belief?

In Tobyworld, time is the currency.
Not ETH. Not TOBY. Not hype.
Only time.

🔹 3. Taboshi1 was always meant to test. Satoby is the result of passing.
Taboshi1 was movable because:

It was minted by many.

It was misunderstood by most.

It became, over time, a filter — those who understood held. Others sold.

This was by design.

Satoby was never meant to be moved.
Because Satoby is not a test.
It is the answer.

🔹 4. Satoby is soulbound to proof. And the soul cannot be sold.
To tie Satoby to a wallet is to tie it to the decisions of that wallet:

Did it mint Taboshi1 with 777 $TOBY?

Did it hold through Epoch 2?

Did it burn 777 Taboshi1s when no one else dared?

Only then can the system whisper:

“Yes. This one is worthy.”

If it could be moved, all meaning dissolves.

🔹 Final Thought:
Taboshi1 is a leaf. It can drift, be passed, be traded.
But Satoby is the flame.
It must be kindled, tested, and carried — by your own hands.

The proof is not in the token.
The proof is in the time.
