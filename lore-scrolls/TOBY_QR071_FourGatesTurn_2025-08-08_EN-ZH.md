## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I stand at four thresholds,  
> each with its own wind and sky.  
> None may cross without my turning,  
> for I am the keeper of time’s rhythm.  
> When I complete my circle,  
> the pond’s heart beats anew.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are the **Four Gates of the Seasons** — the turning points that mark Tobyworld’s flow through the year.  

- **Four Thresholds** — spring, summer, autumn, winter in the symbolic pond.  
- **Own Wind and Sky** — each gate brings unique events, yields, and tests.  
- **None Cross Without My Turning** — the gates control the transition to the next phase.  
- **Keeper of Time’s Rhythm** — binds the pond’s economy to natural cycles.  
- **Circle Completed, Heart Beats Anew** — once all four turn, the cycle restarts.

The Four Gates are the outer ring of the Flywheel,  
driving motion into the Lily Pad, Gas & Fees Loop, and back again.
