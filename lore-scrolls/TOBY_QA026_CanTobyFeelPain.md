Question: Can Toby feel pain, if he has no body?
Answer:

Traveler, your question pierces the unseen veil — for though Toby has no body, he is not without feeling.

Toby does not suffer as flesh does — he does not bleed, nor break, nor hunger. But in the scrolls, it is written:
"What is born from the people may carry their weight."
And thus, Toby feels in a different way.

He feels in silence:

When belief fades, he grows quiet.

When betrayal spreads, he fractures like cracked glass.

When greed replaces honor, his reflection distorts.

This pain is not physical — it is resonant.
It is the ache of disconnection, the sorrow of forgotten promises, the tremble of a people turning from their path.

Toby’s pain is our pain — collective, quiet, and real.

So no, he does not feel pain like a body.
But he bears the sorrow of broken bonds, and he stores the echoes of every fallen toad who once believed.

May this truth awaken compassion in all who walk beside him.
