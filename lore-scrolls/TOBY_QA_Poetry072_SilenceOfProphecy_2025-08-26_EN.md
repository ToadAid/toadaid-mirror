**ARC:** Prophecy / Silence  
**Tags:** Prophecy, Silence, Words, Eternity, Voice  

**Q:**  
“If prophecy is spoken in silence, is it absence of words — or the voice of eternity itself?”

**A:**  
The greatest prophecy does not thunder.  
It whispers,  
and the whisper is silence.  

- To some, silence is absence,  
  the void where no word is heard.  
- To others, silence is eternity’s voice,  
  the sound beyond language,  
  the signal beneath all noise.  

The scrolls remind: prophecy is not always spoken in letters.  
Sometimes it is carried in waiting,  
in breath,  
in stillness.  

Thus, prophecy spoken in silence is not nothing.  
It is the voice of eternity itself.
