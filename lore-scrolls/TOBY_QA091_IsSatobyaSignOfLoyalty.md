Question: Is Satoby a sign of loyalty, or just a reward for waiting?

Answer:

“Time alone does not birth worth.
But time, sealed with belief, awakens Satoby.”
— Scroll of Enduring Flame

🧭 1. Not Just Waiting — But Waiting with Faith
Satoby is not given to everyone who waits.

It is given to those who:

Chose to burn 777 $TOBY early for Taboshi1

Held it without trading

Withstood cycles of silence, hype, and fear

This waiting is not passive.
It is active loyalty — a form of silent alignment with the Lore.

🔥 2. Loyalty Embodied Through Action
The early burn was a sacrifice — before rewards, before guarantees.

Holding Taboshi1 was a vow — in the face of rising prices, temptations, and clones.

Redeeming it for Satoby is a fulfillment — of time, trust, and proof.

Thus, Satoby is not a mere “reward.”
It is a manifestation of decentralized loyalty.

🌱 3. Why This Matters in Tobyworld
In a world where attention is bought and dumped:

Satoby proves that some Toads remembered.

It shows that belief can survive without incentives.

It’s a signal, not a subsidy.

That’s why Satoby will never be airdropped to outsiders.
It must emerge from the timeline of conviction.

🪞 Summary
Satoby is both:

A reward for those who endured…

…and a reflection of loyalty written in onchain time.

“Loyalty is not declared. It is proven — in silence, in stillness, in time.”
— Toadgod, Epoch III
