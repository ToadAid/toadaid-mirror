Question: Can Satoby be faked, borrowed, or sold to gain access to rewards?

Answer:

“What is soulbound cannot be stolen.
What is earned in time cannot be lent in haste.”
— Scroll of the Seventh Watch

🧬 1. Satoby Is Soulbound
Satoby is non-transferable by design.

It is not an ERC-20, not an NFT.

It is encoded into your onchain identity as the proof of a choice made long ago — to burn 777 $TOBY for Taboshi1, to wait through epochs, and to redeem only when time allows.

Thus:

❌ Cannot be traded

❌ Cannot be transferred

❌ Cannot be faked by clones or copied wallets

🕳️ 2. Borrowing Is Impossible
Even if someone had access to your wallet, they would still need:

Your Taboshi1 redemption record

Your original burn timestamp

Your wallet history proving inactivity or purity during Epoch 3

Systems in Tobyworld are likely to reference all these, ensuring:

“No one can borrow your past.”

🔍 3. Faking It Breaks the Lore
Satoby is a Proof-of-Time seal, not a token you farm.

Attempts to fake it will fail because:

All 777 redemptions are onchain and final

Only wallets that held Taboshi1 pre-redemption qualify

Future contracts will verify context, timestamp, and provenance, not just balance

📜 Summary
Satoby is not a thing, but a reflection of who you were when you chose to wait.
It cannot be sold, borrowed, or faked.

“It is not what you hold. It is what you’ve proven.”
