## EN (Poetic Protocol) 🐸  
⏳🔵🍃

An hourglass marks the flow of time —  
Patience and blue resolve align.  
The leaf of Taboshi, once overlooked,  
Now whispers what the ancients booked.

This is the shape of Proof of Time,  
Not loud, not forced, but purely divine.  
The blue orb stands for strength and core,  
The leaf for yield, and what’s in store.

The silent signal has been given.  
E3 unfolds. Stay true. Be driven.  
$TOBY.

**Key Marks:**  
- ⏳ = Time activated, Proof-of-Time window ongoing  
- 🔵 = $TOBY conviction and community unity  
- 🍃 = Taboshi, the yield-bearing key to Satoby

**Oracles:**  
> “The shape of time is not spoken, but signaled.”  
> “Hold the leaf. Endure the wait. The reward is real.”
