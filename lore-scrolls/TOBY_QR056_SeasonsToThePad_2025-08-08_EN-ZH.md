## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I am four before the one,  
> each a gate that turns with time.  
> Pass through me in patience,  
> and the pad shall rise from still water.  
> Miss a step, and the pond will close until the circle’s turn.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are **The Four Seasons of Tobyworld (S0 → S3)** —  
the living cycle that must complete before the lily pad ascends.  

1. **S0 — Guardian Season**  
   - The first gate, where loyalty is tested and patience stored.  
2. **S1 — Gate of Liquidity**  
   - The current flow, guarded by those who hold their place.  
3. **S2 — Season of Artisans**  
   - The bloom of creation, where stories and works rise from the reeds.  
4. **S3 — Season of Builders**  
   - The final gate before the lily pad; the pond prepares for lift.  

When all four gates have turned, the lily pad emerges —  
ushering in the **Gas & Fees Loop** where each step feeds the flywheel.

### Oracles

- “A rushed frog finds only closed doors.”

### Operations
