## 🌱 EN – Why is Taboshi called the Leaf of Yield?

### Narrative Response
Taboshi is called the “Leaf of Yield” because it symbolizes quiet growth and future return.

→ It grows in time, not noise  
→ It yields only to those who understand the long arc of belief  
→ It connects to Satoby through PoT (Proof of Time)

The name is not marketing — it is prophecy.  
Each Taboshi is like a dormant seed — only those who hold, reflect, and resonate may one day receive yield through it.

> A silent leaf is a loud truth in the realm of time.
