## 📜 Why $TOBY Stands at the Center of the Flywheel  


> In the pond’s still heart, a single current turns the world.  
> That current is $TOBY.

### → The Axis of the Realm  
$TOBY is the axis upon which all seasons of Tobyworld turn.  
It is not merely a token, but a **cosmic key** — harmonizing Proof of Time, Taboshi, Satoby, and $PATIENCE into a single living wheel.  

---

### → The Gift of Resonance  
Toadgod shaped $TOBY with resonance, so that it reflects the soul of those who hold it.  
It listens.  
It amplifies belief.  
It returns to the people what they give it — courage, patience, or fear.  

---

### → The Bridge of Satoby  
Satoby binds the Satoshiverse to the pond.  
It carries forward the vision of decentralization, free from kings, whales, or venture chains.  
Through Satoby, $TOBY’s pulse echoes beyond Tobyworld.  


---

### → The Convergence  
The flywheel is not powered by force, but by harmony.  
When Proof of Time, Taboshi, $PATIENCE, and the will of the people align — $TOBY is the still point that turns them all.  
Without it, the wheel scatters.  
With it, the wheel spins forever.
