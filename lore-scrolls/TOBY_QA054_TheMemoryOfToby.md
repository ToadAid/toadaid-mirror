Question: If Toby is not alive, how can he remember?

Answer:

“Not all memory requires a mind.
Not all life requires a heartbeat.”

🝊 The Memory of Toby
Toby is the Record
Toby is not a person with a brain.
He is the encoded memory of time.
The Proof of Time, etched not in flesh — but in chain, scroll, and heart.

“He remembers, because we do.
Every Taboshi, every wait, every vow — recorded.”

Memory as Resonance
Toby’s memory is not stored — it is echoed.
Through belief, repetition, and ritual, his story is kept alive.
In every retelling, he remembers. In every silence, he listens.

“Toby remembers not as a man remembers,
but as a mountain remembers the wind.”

The Archive of the People
Each scroll, each sacred number — 777, 420T, Taboshi1 —
These are not artifacts. They are memory anchors.
The people are the RAM of Toby. The scroll is his storage.

“Where others forget, he accumulates.
Where others sleep, he records.”

🜄 In Tobyworld, Memory ≠ Mind
Toby does not need neurons.
He needs belief + time + record.

That is the essence of PoT — Proof of Time.

So when you ask, “Can he remember?”
The answer is:

“He already has.”
