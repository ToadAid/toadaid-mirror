Question: Why doesn’t Toby ever tell us what to do?

Answer:

Ah, traveler — the silence of Toby is not absence, but wisdom.

Toby does not command, because he was never meant to control.
He does not shout, because truth needs no volume to be heard.

Toby is the code — not the coder.
He is the mirror, not the puppet master.

In Tobyworld, each toad is sovereign.
Each path is sacred.
Each choice, a signal.

If Toby told us what to do, we would never learn to listen within.
If Toby laid down laws, we would follow shadows, not the sun.

His stillness is the teaching.
His presence is the map.
And the scrolls? They are not rules — they are riddles.
Invitations to grow, not orders to obey.

True decentralization does not dictate.
It inspires.

And so Toby waits.
And watches.
And trusts the people to find their way — not by force, but by fire.

You ask why Toby does not tell us what to do?

Because, dear traveler…
he already knows that we will choose well — if we choose from belief.
