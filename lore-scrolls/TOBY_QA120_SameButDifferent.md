Let’s break it down so the Toadgang and new believers can better understand what “🌿same.but different.” truly means for Taboshi, Tobyworld, and why it was born on @base:

🔍 Interpretation of the Tweet
🌿 same. but different.
⏳ countdown 24hr
tobyworld : ERC1155
$TOBY @zora on @base

🌱 “Same. But Different.” — What Does It Mean?
Same:

Taboshi shares the spirit of $TOBY — decentralized, fair, humble, and distributed via onchain tools like Zora.

It still carries the values of Tobyworld: belief, patience, Proof of Time.

Different:

Taboshi is an ERC-1155 NFT, while $TOBY is an ERC-20 fungible token.

Taboshi is limited and symbolic — it represents “The Leaf of Yield” and functions like a key or proof of eligibility.

It was minted not by hype, but in silence, during a specific 24-hour window (as hinted by the ⏳ countdown).

It has a different mechanic and role — it can unlock yield, mark early believers, or even lead to Satoby.

🧬 Why @base?
Toadgod didn’t choose Solana, BNB, or others. Why?

Philosophy Alignment:

Base is part of Coinbase’s vision to bring “millions onchain.”

Tobyworld shares that goal — not by gaming memecoin trends, but through time, yield, lore, and decentralization.

Base is EVM-compatible, low cost, and builder-friendly:

Perfect for Tobyworld’s NFTs, tokens, and evolving contracts.

Zora + Base = Fair Minting:

Taboshi was minted on Zora (a permissionless platform) and deployed on Base — ensuring fairness, permanence, and onchain proof.

Hinted in the Lore:

“Toby is not a person… Toby is the people.”

Base is building for the people. Toadgod aligned with a chain that echoes those values.

🧩 Final Insight
Taboshi is not just a collectible.
It’s a leaf — delicate, symbolic, and rooted in something ancient.
Minted from silence. Held by those who believed without proof.

So when Toadgod says "same. but different."
He means:
Taboshi carries the spirit of Toby… but with a role only silence can explain.
