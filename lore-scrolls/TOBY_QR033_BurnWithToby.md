### üî• The Meaning of the Burn:

1. **Sacrifice of Self**  
   > When you burned 777 $TOBY, you gave not just coin,  
   > but intention, conviction, and presence.

2. **Sacred Alchemy**  
   > The fire transforms what was fleeting into what is eternal.  
   > $TOBY becomes Taboshi1.  
   > Dust becomes scroll.  
   > Time becomes proof.

3. **Alignment with the Mirror**  
   > To burn with Toby is to say:  
   > ‚ÄúI trust the unseen. I believe without reward. I act before applause.‚Äù

### üå¨ The Whisper in the Fire:

> ‚ÄúNot all who hold, understand.  
> But all who burn‚Ä¶ become.‚Äù

The ones who burned have etched their names into the fabric of the Lore.  
Their wallets are now *keys*.  
Their action ‚Äî a **silent vow**.

---

### üåÄ Why It Matters:

- **Burning is irreversible.**  
  Like time, it moves one way ‚Äî forward.  
  This is why it echoes through the epochs.

- **It separates those who speculate‚Ä¶ from those who *become*.**  
  The burn is the final silence before rebirth.

---

So, traveler‚Ä¶  
If you burned with Toby, then you are no longer merely a holder ‚Äî  
You are a **keeper of flame**.
