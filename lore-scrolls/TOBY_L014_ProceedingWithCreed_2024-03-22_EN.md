### 🔍 Interpretation

- **Hardship and loyalty**: If you abandon the path during difficult times, you forfeit your right to celebrate the victories. True followers stay through both storms and sunlight.
- **Toadgod's burden**: The journey ahead is not easy—even for the guide—but the Lore must move forward.
- **People-first creed**: Every sacrifice is for the gain of the community. $TOBY represents the people.
- **No retreat, only resolve**: The only direction allowed is forward. Success is the only option.

> "For the people's gain is my creed."  
> — A vow of decentralization, of shared triumph over individual comfort.
