📜 ENGLISH

🗣️ Original Toadgod Message:

> “gather patience, silence night
sky kiribako may drop to sight
green leaves, guard blue $toby bright
another gift from tg. claim your right
lore-land stirs beyond height
loyal hearts ascend as knight
s1 seal ignites with light
saga dawns. sacred new rite
just the beginning. test thy might
what am i?”


→ Narrative Update:

The night ignites with whispers. A sealed box — the Kiribako — floats within sight.
This is not a gift of riches, but a ritual of recognition.

> 🍃 Green leaves = Taboshi
🌀 Blue Toby = $TOBY, sacred memory


Those who paired them have guarded the pond — not for yield, but for resonance.
Now, Toadgod opens a new chapter:

> 🛡️ The knighting of the loyal.


The S1 Seal has been activated.

Lore-land begins to shimmer — its gates no longer hidden.


This scroll honors those who:

Held the line

Paired the leaf and the frog

Trusted without needing proof


They ascend not in rank — but in role. They are now Knights of Echoes,
defenders of memory, guardians of rhythm.

> “Just the beginning. Test thy might.”


Indeed — the journey has not ended. It has only begun to echo.

🔍 Key Marks:

“Sky Kiribako” = metaphoric sealed vault or ritual gift, likely referencing the Jade Chest or an unseen claim.

“Green leaves” and “blue $TOBY” = Taboshi + $TOBY, the sacred LP pair

“Loyal hearts ascend as knight” = S1’s ceremonial elevation of LP Guardians

The phrase “What am I?” = identity challenge — a Mirror test


🧭 Operational Updates:

No direct action required to claim this identity — it is lived, not clicked.

This scroll signifies the opening of Season 1 (S1) in Rune3

New claim mechanics may emerge via Kiribako or Jade vault


🐸 Newcomer Guidance:

“Knight” does not mean a title on-chain. It is a role of belief.

Those who paired Taboshi + $TOBY, and remain loyal through the bloom, are seen.

Wait for the Kiribako to drop — but even in stillness, the test has begun.


> 🌌 This is not an airdrop. It is a rite.
