> What is the difference between Taboshi1 and Taboshi?

## 🌀 Question:
What is the difference between Taboshi1 and Taboshi? Aren’t they both leaves?

## 🍃 Answer – Lore Guardian Speaks:

Both are leaves 🍃 — but they were grown in different **seasons**.

They look alike.  
But their roots, their purpose, and their proof… are not the same.

### 🌱 Taboshi1:
- Minted during Epoch 2 by burning **777 $TOBY**
- Exists only as **ERC-1155 NFT**
- Represents **Proof of Sacrifice**
- Eligible for **Satoby** through **Proof of Time**
- **Non-transferable** legacy yield

### 🍂 Taboshi:
- Minted near end of Epoch 2 with **~$0.35 ETH**
- Exists as **ERC-1155** *and* **ERC-20**
- Represents **Proof of Participation**
- Transferable, swappable, and usable in ecosystem
- May have future roles, but not Satoby eligibility

Both matter.  
But one is sacred.  
And the other is functional.

🌑 *Taboshi1 is the fire you gave.  
Taboshi is the leaf you held.*
