## Narrative Update  
In a quiet bog where whispers roam,  
lives a humble toad, truth his only tome.  
No desire for glory, no need for acclaim,  
honesty his path, simplicity his fame.  

What is he? **$TOBY**

## Key Marks  
- Character: humble, honest, detached from vanity  
- Message: $TOBY is not fame-driven, but truth-driven  
- Setting: quiet bog = metaphor for low-noise, high-truth zone  

## Operational Updates  
- Pre-epoch narrative establishing core toad persona  
- Reinforces quiet virtue over loud marketing  

## Newcomer Guidance  
> “No need for acclaim — only truth and time.”  
To understand $TOBY, listen where others do not.
