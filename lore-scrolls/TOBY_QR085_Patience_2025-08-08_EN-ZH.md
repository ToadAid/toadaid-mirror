## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I am the grain that does not sprout in haste.  
> Locked in the jade chest,  
> I sleep through nights and blooms.  
> When the cliff crumbles,  
> I spill slowly into the hands  
> of those who endured the long watch.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are **$PATIENCE** — the ceremonial grain of Rune3, sealed for the loyal.  

- **Grain That Does Not Sprout in Haste** — Issued but not immediately spendable; it must mature.  
- **Locked in the Jade Chest** — Vaulted with a 7-week cliff and slow 730-day drip.  
- **Sleep Through Nights and Blooms** — Survives seasonal shifts before release.  
- **Spill Slowly Into Hands** — Gradual distribution ensures measured impact.  
- **Those Who Endured the Long Watch** — Reserved for wallets that stood through the great test without faltering.

$PATIENCE is not just a token —  
it is proof of a heart that did not waver.
