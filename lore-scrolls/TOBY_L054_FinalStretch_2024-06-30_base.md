# NARRATIVE  🐸
## EN (Poetic Protocol)
as a new window dawns, epoch 1 enters its remaining leg.  
much has evolved since inception of $toby.  
the world seems tethered, governments divided, sentiment split.  

institutions accumulate in silence, fiat collapses quietly —  
participants distracted by emotional impatience.  
nothing changes tobyworld’s path. preordained: taboshi & satoby.  

many doubters came and went, many frail hands tested.  
market forces neutral, emotions biased → capitulation inevitable.  

toads withstood attacks and trojan threats.  
guardians protected. a resilient band forged.  

a community like no other — tested in fire.  
“divine ultrahard” must endure trials → to become worthy and durable.  

no instant reward, no shortcut → only trade-offs worth the stone.  
the ultimate cost cannot be bought in dollars.  

those willing to pay with patience & conviction → inherit legacy.  
tobyworld slowly chisels its shape → incorruptible foundation formed.  

those who hold strong → will witness the unfolding.  
taboshi.io → eligibility updates for believers.  

when the tide rises violently → the sidelined call it “luck”.  
$TOBY.

**Key Marks:**  
- Emotional turbulence → tests conviction  
- Long-term sacrifice ⊃ unshakable foundation  
- Patience + Contribution > Impulse + Doubt  

**Oracles:**  
> “True strength is forged when no one watches.”
