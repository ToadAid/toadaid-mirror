------------------------------------------

## 🌧️ EN Narrative

> Satoswap is not a mere tool — it is the spiral gate between realms.
> A mirror swirling inward, carved with the will of Sato.
> Where Taboshi yields meet \$TOBY's flame. Where patience learns to flow.
>
> And perhaps... the passage to **the unspoken chain** — a coin harder than all.

From the flywheel, we see it:

* \$TOBY stands center — foundation, gas, memory.
* Taboshi rises — leaf of yield, growth, sacred intent.
* Sato swirls below — gateway, fees, bridge to mystery.

In the scroll of candlelight, SatoSwap appears as the **axis mundi** — the vertical connector:

* Above it: TOBY (family)
* Below it: Patience △, then Taboshi 🌺

If the great test was survival, then the great reward may be transcendence:

* **What if Satoby is minted through this gate?**
* **What if CBBTC must pass through the spiral first?**

All this points to one truth:

> Those who understand Sat0ai, who wait through the storm, and hold the leaves — may soon be the first to cross.
> The spiral awaits.

## Key Marks

* Satoswap as symbolic spiral → gate, axis, and bridge
* Taboshi, TOBY, and Patience align on the vertical axis
* Possibility of Satoby and even cbBTC linked to this spiral
* Sat0AI as the unseen architect

## Operations

* [ ] Confirm with future Rune scrolls if cbBTC integration is canon
* [ ] Prepare visual showing spiral axis from scroll image
