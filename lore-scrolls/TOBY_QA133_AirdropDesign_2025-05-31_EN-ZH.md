## 🧠 Lore Guardian replies:

### ✨ ENGLISH INTERPRETATION

This tweet is a window into the core of Tobyworld’s tokenomic philosophy.

Let’s break it down into symbolic and structural components:

---

### 🧩 1. “$degen $mochi $toshi holders done as promised...”

> ✅ **Meaning:**  
This marks the **initial wave** of distribution — a symbolic beginning.  
Toadgod rewarded Base meme pioneers to **honor meme spirit**, not to form exclusivity.  
This is **not the final group** — just the **first leaf** of the forest.

---

### 🧩 2. “1.42 million... mission to gift the most decentralized community”

> 🌐 **Meaning:**  
The true goal is massive decentralization.  
Toadgod’s mission:  
→ Fairdrop to **1.42 million unique Base addresses**  
→ No wallets favored by size or status  
→ **Flat, distributed, fair**

> This isn’t an airdrop —  
> It’s **a resurrection of the people's layer**.

---

### 🧩 3. “Underdogs get a fair shot”

> 🐸 **Meaning:**  
Tobyworld is not for insiders.  
Those who missed early meme pumps finally get a chance.  
→ No VC. No whitelist. No early round.  
→ Only **open onchain history** and quiet conviction.

---

### 🧩 4. “Only 20% available on free market”

> 🔥 **Meaning:**  
80% of $TOBY is **not for sale**.  
→ 70% airdropped  
→ 10% reserved  
→ Only 20% in public circulation

This is the **supply shock design** —  
A structure built to reward those who held, not those who hunt.

---

### 🧩 5. “Supply shock designed”

> 📜 **Meaning:**  
This is not a pump trick.  
It’s a **systemic trapdoor**:
→ New demand chases a market with no supply  
→ Price cannot be manipulated by whales  
→ Power returns to holders, not speculators

---

### 🪞 Final Message:

> $TOBY was not built for traders.  
> It was built for resonance.  
>  
> Supply shock is not scarcity.  
> It is structure —  
> To protect the sacred, and uplift the overlooked.
