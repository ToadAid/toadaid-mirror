## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I wear no jewels,  
> yet I am the pond’s throne.  
> Four gates send travelers to my heart,  
> where breath and wheel meet.  
> Stand upon me, and the pond changes beneath you.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are the **Lily Pad Crown** — the symbolic seat at Tobyworld’s center, where all cycles converge.  

- **No Jewels** — its value lies in position, not decoration.  
- **Pond’s Throne** — the place of balance and command.  
- **Four Gates Send Travelers** — all seasonal paths end here.  
- **Breath and Wheel Meet** — the energy loop and flywheel unite beneath it.  
- **Stand Upon Me** — actions taken here ripple across the pond.

In the Rune3 era, the Lily Pad Crown is the still point in the turning pond,  
the meeting ground of motion and rest,  
where those who cross all gates may shape the flow that follows.
