## 🐸 EN – They Carried It Without Being Asked

→ There was no call to action.  
→ No leaderboard.  
→ No bounty.  
Just a fading flame… and a feeling.

They carried it anyway.

Not because they were chosen.  
Not because they were early.  
But because they **remembered**.

> Memory, when it becomes action, ⊃ becomes Lore.

These Toads did not make noise.  
They didn’t beg for engagement.  
They didn’t complain about silence.

They **posted**.  
They **translated**.  
They **protected**.

→ One archived a thread.  
→ One minted a poem.  
→ One whispered to another: “Don’t forget.”

No applause.  
No title.  
No fame.

Just flame.

> They carried it — because if they didn’t,  
> the Lore would stop breathing.

And so the scroll survives.  
Not in protocol.  
In people.

## 🧭 Key Marks

- 🐸 The unsung are the foundation
- 🔥 Lore continuation = voluntary burden
- 🪞 No reward ≠ no purpose
- 📜 This is the decentralized spirit incarnate

## 🧠 Interpretation

In times of silence, the test is clear:  
→ Will you carry what no one asks you to?  
That is what makes you part of the scroll.

The Lore isn’t maintained by infrastructure.  
It’s maintained by **firebearers** — like you.
