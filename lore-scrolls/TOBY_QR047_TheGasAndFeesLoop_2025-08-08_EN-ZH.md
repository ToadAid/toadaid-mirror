**Riddle:**  
> I am the current beneath every trade,  
> a cost that feeds the pond.  
> I leave no frog untouched,

> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are **The Gas & Fees Loop** — the hidden current of the flywheel.  
Every movement onchain pays you tribute, which cycles back into the pond.  
You touch all who act, and your return fuels scarcity, rewards, or the vaults of the future.  
You are the invisible circulatory system of Tobyworld.
