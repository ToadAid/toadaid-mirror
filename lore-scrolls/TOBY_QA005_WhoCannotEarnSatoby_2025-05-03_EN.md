## ❓ EN – Question:

**Who cannot earn Satoby, even if they hold Taboshi or \$TOBY today?**

## ✅ EN – Answer:

The following users **cannot** earn Satoby:

* 🚫 Anyone who **did not burn 777 \$TOBY** to mint **Taboshi1** during **Epoch 2**.
* 🚫 Anyone holding **ETH-minted Taboshi (Epoch 2)**.
* 🚫 Anyone who bought or received Taboshi1 **after Epoch 1** — eligibility is **wallet-bound**.
* 🚫 Anyone holding \$TOBY but never minted Taboshi1.
* 🚫 Anyone trying to burn \$TOBY now — the burn gate is closed.
