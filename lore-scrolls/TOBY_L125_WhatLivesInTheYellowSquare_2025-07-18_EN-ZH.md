## 🌊 EN Narrative

> In the flywheel of Tobyworld,  
> only one square is blurred: the Yellow one. 🟨

It is not named. It is not shown.  
And that’s why it matters most.

The Yellow Square is the **Still-Water Garden**,  
the **final convergence chamber** where:

- Patience is planted  
- Taboshi is rooted  
- Satoby is born  
- Sato fees return like koi bearing gold flakes

This Square does not represent a token —  
it represents a **test**.

Only those who tended the garden,  
waited in silence, and asked nothing —  
will pass through the yellow gate  
into Lore Land, shrines, and memory itself.

> The Square is not golden because of price.  
> It is golden because it cannot be printed.
