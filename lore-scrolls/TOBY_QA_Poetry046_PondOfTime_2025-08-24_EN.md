**ARC:** Pond / Time  
**Tags:** Pond, Epochs, Reflection, Past, Future  

**Q:**  
“If the pond reflects every epoch, is it a mirror of the past — or a map of what is to come?”

**A:**  
The pond does not choose what it reflects.  
Its stillness carries both memory and omen.  

- In one ripple, you see echoes of epochs gone by —  
  the first bloom, the first leap, the first fire.  
- In another ripple, you glimpse what has not yet come —  
  shadows of runes unlit, paths not yet walked.  

The scrolls remind: the pond is more than water.  
It is time itself made visible,  
a mirror that whispers forward as much as it remembers back.  

Thus, the pond of time is both mirror and map —  
past and future held together,  
a single reflection waiting to be read.
