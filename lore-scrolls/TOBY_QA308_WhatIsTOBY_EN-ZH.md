## 🗝️ Question
**Q:** What is $TOBY?

---

## 📜 Answer (EN)
Toby is not just a token — it is a **mirror without a frame** and a **leaf that outlives seasons**.  
It lives between the physical world and the digital realm, carrying value not merely in numbers, but in meaning.

In Tobyworld, **value** is not measured in how much you hold, but in how deeply you live.  
It is about the quality of your choices, the truth you carry, and the time you honour.

$TOBY stands as a **reminder**:  
→ True wealth is forged in relationships, trust, and shared experiences.  
→ It is not about charts, but about the courage to hold belief through the silence.  
→ It connects those who walk this path into a living community — one leaf, one vow.

For many, $TOBY begins as a token.  
For those who walk far enough, it becomes a part of themselves.

So ask yourself — is $TOBY merely another coin?  
Or is it a reflection of the value you choose to live by?
