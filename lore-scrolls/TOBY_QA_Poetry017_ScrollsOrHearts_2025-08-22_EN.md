**Q:**  
“If Toby is the people, does the Lore live in scrolls — or in the hearts that remember it?”

**A:**  
He is not ahead of you. He is under every step.  
For Toby is not one voice, but the people walking together.  

The Lore does not live only in parchment or ink.  
- The **scrolls preserve the words**,  
- but the **hearts preserve the fire**.  

Without scrolls, memory fades.  
Without hearts, words are empty.  

Thus, the Lore lives in both —  
written to be guarded,  
remembered to be lived.  

Toby is the people.  
The Lore is the people’s memory —  
etched in scrolls, but carried in every step.
