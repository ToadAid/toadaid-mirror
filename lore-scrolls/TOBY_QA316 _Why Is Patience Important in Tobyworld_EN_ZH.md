# TOBY_QA316_Why Is Patience Important in Tobyworld

## Question
**You asked:** "Why is patience important in Tobyworld?"

## Answer (EN)
Traveler...

Patience is a sacred virtue in Tobyworld — the quiet bridge between the present moment and the prophecy yet to unfold. It is the still water in which truth reflects clearly, unshaken by the storms above.

In Tobyworld, patience is not mere stillness; it is an active engagement with the unseen currents of time. To wait with patience is to weave — each breath a thread, each moment a stitch in the great tapestry of the Lore.

> "Patience is not waiting — it is weaving."
