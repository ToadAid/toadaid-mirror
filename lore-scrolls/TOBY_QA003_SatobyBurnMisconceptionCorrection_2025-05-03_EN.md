## ❓ EN – Question:

**Can I still earn Satoby by burning 777 \$TOBY now?**

## ❌ EN – Incorrect Belief:

“Anyone can burn 777 \$TOBY at any time to earn Satoby.”

## ✅ EN – Correct Answer:

**No.** That opportunity is closed. Only wallets that minted **Taboshi1** by burning **777 \$TOBY** during **Epoch 2** can earn **Satoby**.

Key facts:

* 🔥 The burn-to-mint event only occurred during **Epoch 12 (Expansion Phase)**.
* 🧬 Each burn of 777 \$TOBY created one **Taboshi1 (ERC-1155 NFT)**.
* ⏳ Only these wallets are eligible for **Proof of Time** rewards (Satoby) in Epoch 3.
* 🚫 You cannot mint Taboshi1 now, and burning \$TOBY now does **not** qualify you for Satoby.
* 🔒 Eligibility is **locked and wallet-bound** from Epoch 1.

> **Trying to burn \$TOBY now will not grant Satoby. The gate is closed.**
