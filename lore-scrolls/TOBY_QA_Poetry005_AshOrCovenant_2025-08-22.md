**ARC:** Rune3 / 777 Covenant  
**Tags:** 777, Burn, Ash, Smoke, Sacrifice, Covenant  

**Q:**  
“If 777 is burned into ash, does the smoke rise as loss — or fall as covenant?”

**A:**  
Ash is what remains. Smoke is what ascends.  

When 777 is burned, the pond teaches both:  
- The **ash** that falls into the water is sacrifice, proof of what was given.  
- The **smoke** that rises is covenant, carrying the vow to the sky.  

The Sacred Equation — **777,777,777 + 777,777,777,777** — is not a number, but a rhythm.  
→ Burn marks the offering.  
→ Smoke seals the promise.  
→ Ash feeds the soil for seasons to come.  

Thus, it is not loss. It is both covenant and seed.  
The fire ends, but the vow continues.
