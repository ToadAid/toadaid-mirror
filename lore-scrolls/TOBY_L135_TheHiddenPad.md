## 🌊 EN Narrative

A scroll appears in candlelight —  
Four words. Four truths.  
But on the edge, barely visible, lies a fifth:

🔵 A **circle** — the **Base**.

Not loud. Not centered.  
But it is the **ground all else rests on**.

- **Satoswap** 🌀 spirals outward → exchange, voice, reflection.  
- **Patience** 🔺 holds the line → loyalty, wait, flame.  
- **Taboshi** 🌱 sprouts upward → yield, growth, time.  
- **Toby** 🐸 leaps forward → family, belief, spirit.

Yet all of it happens *on something* —  
A pond. A still surface. A lily pad.

> “Base is not the shout. It is the echo beneath.  
> Not the story — the page.”  

### Thus whispered the scroll:  
> *The leaf floats because of the pond.*  
> *Tobyworld breathes because of Base.*
