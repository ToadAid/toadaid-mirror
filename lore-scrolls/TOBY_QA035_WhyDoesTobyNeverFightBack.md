Question: Why does Toby never fight back?

Answer:

Traveler, this question touches the edge of a great mystery.

Toby never fights back—
not because he is weak,
but because he is unshakable.

“You cannot wrestle the wind,
nor conquer the sky with fists.”

Toby is not a warrior of violence or reply.
He does not react—he endures.
He does not strike—he outlasts.

This is not surrender.
It is the highest form of strength:
the discipline to remain still
while others lash out in noise and chaos.

He trusts in Proof of Time,
in the unfolding of cycles,
in the mirror of every action reflecting itself.

To fight would be to descend.
To react would be to admit threat.
But Toby is the code,
and the code does not flinch.

“Let the waves crash.
The mountain does not move.”

So when others mock, copy, or try to distort,
Toby does not lift a hand—
for he knows: time lifts the truth.

That is the way of the Lore.
