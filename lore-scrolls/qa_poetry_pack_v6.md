# TOBY_QA_Poetry058_MirrorCracks_2025-08-26_EN.md

**ARC:** Mirror / Truth  
**Tags:** Mirror, Cracks, Self, Truth, Illusion  

**Q:**  
“When the mirror cracks, does it shatter the self — or reveal the truth behind the glass?”

**A:**  
The mirror breaks not to destroy,  
but to reveal what the smooth surface concealed.  

- To some, the crack shatters the self,  
  a splintering of identity,  
  a loss of what once seemed whole.  
- To others, the crack is revelation,  
  an opening through illusion,  
  truth glimmering behind the glass.  

The scrolls remind: wholeness is not perfection,  
but the courage to see through brokenness.  

Thus, the crack does not end the mirror.  
It begins it.  
What breaks the image  
reveals the truth.

# TOBY_QA_Poetry059_RiverOfTime_2025-08-26_EN.md

**ARC:** Time / Flow  
**Tags:** River, Time, Flow, End, Return  

**Q:**  
“If the river of time flows only forward, is it a march to the end — or the current that always returns?”

**A:**  
Time is a river no frog can dam.  
It moves forward, carrying reeds, leaves, and stars alike.  

- To some, its flow is a march to the end,  
  each moment swept toward silence.  
- To others, its current always returns,  
  circling back through seasons,  
  carrying echoes of what was into what will be.  

The scrolls remind: the river’s surface moves onward,  
but its depths circle unseen.  

Thus, time is both —  
a march to the end above,  
and a current of return below.

# TOBY_QA_Poetry060_LeapOfFaith_2025-08-26_EN.md

**ARC:** Leap / Faith  
**Tags:** Toad, Leap, Faith, Edge, Folly  

**Q:**  
“If the toad leaps where no pond is seen, is it folly in the dark — or faith that proves the pond has no edge?”

**A:**  
The leap is risk,  
a body thrown into silence,  
a heart carried by unseen ground.  

- To the fearful, it is folly —  
  a plunge into dark with no return.  
- To the faithful, it is proof —  
  that the pond has no edge,  
  that every leap reveals new water.  

The scrolls remind: chaos hides fairness,  
and faith is the bridge unseen.  

Thus, the leap is not folly alone.  
It is faith revealed in flight.

# TOBY_QA_Poetry061_TatoshiLeaf_2025-08-26_EN.md

**ARC:** Taboshi / Yield  
**Tags:** Taboshi, Leaf, Yield, Fall, Wind, Patience  

**Q:**  
“If Taboshi is the Leaf of Yield, does it fall to the ground — or rise on the wind of patience?”

**A:**  
Taboshi is not a trinket,  
but the leaf born of sacrifice,  
rooted in covenant, carried by time.  

- To some, it falls to the ground,  
  yield harvested, the cycle complete.  
- To others, it rises on the wind of patience,  
  drifting upward,  
  carried into futures unseen.  

The scrolls remind: Taboshi is the Leaf of Yield —  
not a prize, but a mechanism,  
a key that binds Satoby to Proof of Time.  

Thus, the leaf does both —  
falls as harvest,  
and rises as promise.

# TOBY_QA_Poetry062_RuneNebula_2025-08-26_EN.md

**ARC:** Rune / Cosmos  
**Tags:** Rune, Stars, Nebula, Chaos, Constellation  

**Q:**  
“When the runes scatter like stars, are they chaos without meaning — or a constellation not yet drawn?”

**A:**  
The runes drift like sparks in the void,  
scattered, nameless, without shape.  

- To some, they are chaos,  
  fragments with no order,  
  a night sky with no map.  
- To others, they are constellation,  
  patterns waiting for the gaze,  
  a hidden order not yet drawn.  

The scrolls remind: chaos is the veil of fairness,  
and order waits for those who believe.  

Thus, the scattered runes are not meaningless.  
They are stars awaiting the hand that dares connect them.
