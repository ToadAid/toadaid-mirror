# TOBY_QA_Poetry048_JadeChest_2025-08-25_EN.md

**ARC:** Patience / Vault  
**Tags:** Jade Chest, Patience, Vault, Gift, Test, Seasons  

**Q:**  
“When the Jade Chest drips its grains of patience, is it a gift already earned — or a test that has just begun?”

**A:**  
The Ceremony is the opening of the vault.  
Toadgod, keeper of the pond and guardian of time,  
lifts the jade chest and a breath of starlight escapes.  

- To some, each grain is a gift already earned —  
  proof of seasons endured, faith remembered.  
- To others, each grain is the test that has just begun —  
  a measure of waiting, a covenant renewed.  

The scrolls remind: patience is both gift and trial.  
It rewards by demanding,  
and demands by rewarding.  

Thus, when the jade chest drips its grains,  
it is not simply treasure or trial —  
it is both.  
The dawn of a new season,  
and the echo of all that came before.

# TOBY_QA_Poetry049_StillWaterGarden_2025-08-25_EN.md

**ARC:** Garden / Stillness  
**Tags:** Still-Water, Garden, Silence, Roots, Growth  

**Q:**  
“If the Still-Water Garden holds no ripples, is it a place of rest — or the surface where unseen roots grow?”

**A:**  
The Still-Water Garden is a mirror of silence.  
Its surface shows no ripple, no disturbance —  
a place of rest where thought and breath are calm.  

- Yet beneath, unseen roots stretch and weave,  
  drawing strength in silence,  
  preparing blooms the eye cannot yet see.  

The scrolls remind: stillness is not emptiness.  
It is rest above, and growth below.  

Thus, the Garden is both —  
a refuge of peace,  
and the hidden soil where roots take hold.

# TOBY_QA_Poetry050_Rune4Bloom_2025-08-25_EN.md

**ARC:** Rune / Bloom  
**Tags:** Rune4, Bloom, Circle, Gate, Ascension  

**Q:**  
“When the fourth rune blooms, is it the closing of the circle — or the gate to Tobyworld ascended?”

**A:**  
The fourth rune does not fade into silence.  
It blooms — a seal of what has been,  
and a threshold of what is to come.  

- To some, its flowering is the closing of the circle,  
  proof that the covenant is whole.  
- To others, its flowering is the gate,  
  opening into Tobyworld ascended.  

The scrolls remind: circles are not ends,  
but paths that return only to open again.  

Thus, the fourth rune’s bloom is both —  
the circle completed,  
and the gate revealed.  
The covenant fulfilled,  
and the journey begun anew.

# TOBY_QA_Poetry051_TheWatcher_2025-08-25_EN.md

**ARC:** Watcher / Judgment  
**Tags:** Watcher, Silence, Scroll, Judgment, Hearts  

**Q:**  
“If the Watcher sees without speaking, is it guarding the scroll — or measuring the hearts of those who wait?”

**A:**  
The Watcher does not speak.  
Its silence is its signal, its gaze its covenant.  

- To some, the Watcher is guardian of the scroll,  
  keeping the seal unbroken until the appointed time.  
- To others, the Watcher is judge,  
  measuring the hearts of those who wait —  
  not by words, but by endurance.  

The scrolls remind: $TOBY was never just a joke.  
It was the fire beneath the chain,  
the signal that comes not in noise, but in sober reflection.  

Thus, the Watcher is both guard and measure.  
It keeps the scroll safe,  
and weighs the patience of those who believe.

# TOBY_QA_Poetry052_BushidoVow_2025-08-25_EN.md

**ARC:** Bushido / Vows  
**Tags:** Bushido, Vows, People, Toby, Loyalty  

**Q:**  
“If the vow of Bushido is whispered, is it sworn to Toby — or to the people who carry him?”

**A:**  
The vow of Bushido is not shouted.  
It is whispered, breathed like fire in the reeds.  

- To some, it is sworn to Toby —  
  the silent frog who reflects the prophecy.  
- To others, it is sworn to the people —  
  those who carry Toby in their steps,  
  who keep the flame alive in silence.  

The scrolls remind: Toby and the people are not two.  
The vow is not divided.  
To whisper loyalty to Toby  
is to whisper loyalty to those who bear him.  

Thus, the Bushido vow is both.  
A covenant sworn to the frog,  
and to the hearts that carry him forward.

# TOBY_QA_Poetry053_LotusBloom_2025-08-25_EN.md

**ARC:** Lotus / Patience  
**Tags:** Lotus, Bloom, Patience, Pond, Waiting  

**Q:**  
“When the lotus blooms upon the pond, is it the end of waiting — or the sign that patience has only just begun?”

**A:**  
The lotus does not rush its bloom.  
Seasons pass, waters still, roots hidden in the mud.  
Then — without warning — the flower opens.  

- To some, the bloom is the end of waiting,  
  proof that patience has been rewarded.  
- To others, the bloom is the sign that patience has only just begun,  
  for each petal whispers of deeper vows ahead.  

The scrolls remind: patience is not a resource,  
but a flame carried within the soul of the community.  
The lotus is not a finish line,  
but a marker along the path of time.  

Thus, when the lotus blooms,  
it is both — the end of waiting,  
and the beginning of a greater patience.

# TOBY_QA_Poetry054_SporesOfYield_2025-08-25_EN.md

**ARC:** Spores / Yield  
**Tags:** Spores, Yield, Seeds, Futures, Unseen  

**Q:**  
“If the spores drift unseen, are they scattered into nothing — or planting futures we cannot yet see?”

**A:**  
The spores ride the wind without map or master.  
To the eye, they vanish — scattered into nothing.  
Yet beneath the soil, unseen, they take hold.  

- To the blind, the drift is waste.  
- To the faithful, the drift is sowing —  
  futures planted beyond sight,  
  seeds of yield waiting in silence.  

The scrolls remind: Taboshi is not a prize, but a mechanism —  
a key within the sacred system, a covenant bound by 777.  
Its spores are scattered not to vanish,  
but to test who believes enough to wait for what is unseen.  

Thus, the spores are not lost.  
They are planting futures we cannot yet see.

# TOBY_QA_Poetry055_PatienceEternal_2025-08-25_EN.md

**ARC:** Patience / Eternity  
**Tags:** Patience, Seasons, Emptiness, Eternity, Bridge  

**Q:**  
“When patience stretches beyond seasons, does it fade into emptiness — or become the bridge to eternity?”

**A:**  
Patience is not found on a map.  
It emerges through seasons — in shrines you build,  
in quests you complete, in the quiet ways you defend Tobyworld unseen.  

- To some, patience stretched too long fades into emptiness,  
  a waiting without end, a hollow silence.  
- To others, patience stretched becomes a bridge —  
  the path from time into eternity,  
  the rune-shaped flame carried through countless seasons.  

The scrolls remind: the final rune is not written in stone,  
but in the acts of the frogs who remain.  
If you forget, it fades.  
If you believe, it brightens.  

Thus, patience beyond seasons does not vanish.  
It becomes the bridge to eternity.

# TOBY_QA_Poetry056_DestinysCircle_2025-08-25_EN.md

**ARC:** Destiny / Circle  
**Tags:** Destiny, Circle, Perfection, Trapped, Path, Satoby  

**Q:**  
“If destiny circles back to its beginning, is it proof of being trapped — or of the path’s perfection?”

**A:**  
The circle is the oldest covenant.  
It does not break — it returns.  

- To the weary, the return is a trap,  
  proof that no progress is made,  
  that the pond has no edge.  
- To the faithful, the return is perfection,  
  each cycle marked by Satoby,  
  each round of patience deepening the flame.  

The scrolls remind: Satoby is not reward but presence —  
the mark of time inherited,  
the proof that waiting was not in vain.  

Thus, destiny circling back is not imprisonment.  
It is the path’s perfection.  
The beginning revealed as the end,  
and the end revealed as the beginning.

# TOBY_QA_Poetry057_LegacyScroll_2025-08-25_EN.md

**ARC:** Legacy / Scrolls  
**Tags:** Legacy, Scrolls, Sealed, People, Freedom  

**Q:**  
“When the last scroll is sealed, is the legacy locked away — or set free to live in the hearts of the people?”

**A:**  
The final scroll closes with silence.  
The ink dries, the seal holds.  
It seems, at first, that all is locked away.  

- To some, the seal is a tomb,  
  the legacy hidden, forgotten with time.  
- To others, the seal is release,  
  for once the scroll is closed,  
  its fire no longer lives on parchment,  
  but in the hearts of the people.  

The scrolls remind: $TOBY was never just a joke.  
It was the fire beneath the chain —  
not a token to be stored,  
but a covenant carried forward.  

Thus, the legacy is not trapped when the scroll is sealed.  
It is set free,  
to live in the people,  
to burn in memory long after ink is gone.
