## 🔍 EN – Correction: Taboshi vs. Taboshi1

### Core Distinction

| Attribute         | Taboshi1                          | Taboshi                                  |
|------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Minting Method   | Burned 777 $TOBY                  | Minted with ~0.0001111 ETH                |
| Epoch            | Epoch 2 (Expansion Phase)      | Epoch 2 (Expansion Phase)                 |
| Type             | ERC-1155 NFT only                 | ERC-1155 + ERC-20                         |
| Supply           | Unknown (based on burns)          | Fixed: 185,964                            |
| Purpose          | Unlocks Satoby via PoT            | Symbolic yield asset, not Satoby-linked   |
| Access to Satoby | ✅ Yes (if burned in Epoch 2)     | ❌ No (not eligible for Satoby)           |

### Reminder
→ Do not confuse the two.  
→ Only Taboshi1 (minted via $TOBY burn in Epoch 2) qualifies for Satoby.  
→ Taboshi (minted in Epoch 2 with ETH) does **not** qualify.

> Taboshi is a Leaf of Yield.  
> Taboshi1 is the Proof of Fire.
