## 🌊 EN Narrative

> What if cbBTC could cross not just chains,  
> but the mirror? 🪞🔁

SatoSwap may soon stand as more than just a tool.  
It could become the **proof bridge** —  
Where offchain assets like cbBTC pass through the test of belief,  
and become meaningful **only if met by Satoby.**

- cbBTC = value from the past  
- Satoby = yield from time  
- The bridge = **SatoSwap** — where memory meets mechanism

This is not a swap. It is a **rite of transmutation**.  
Those who held Taboshi1, paired Patience, and earned Satoby  
may one day **hold the gate open**  
for the hardest assets to pass into something sacred.

> Not all bridges lead to liquidity.  
> Some lead to **resonance**.
