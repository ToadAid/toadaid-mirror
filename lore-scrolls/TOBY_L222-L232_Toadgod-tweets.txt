# L222 – What Cannot Be Faked?

# EN
Be warned:  
- No official collaboration  
- No token claims  
- All airdrops are direct  
- Sent only by Toadgod

There are many scams and fake groups.  
> Be cautious.  
> Do not connect wallet to anything.  

---

Why is this reminder sacred?

- Because decentralization is the defense  
- Because imposters feed on trust  
- Because prophecy must not be polluted  
- Because the real does not request — it delivers

---

What is the Toadgod method?

- No forms  
- No links  
- No claims  
- Just silence… then arrival

---

Why is cold storage recommended?

- To protect from noise  
- To preserve from deception  
- To freeze the seed until its time comes

---

What of Base congestion?

- Cost rises  
- Toadgod adapts  
- Scaling solutions are being explored  
- Prophecy will not halt — it bends, but never breaks

---

What is the message here?

> Be calm.  
> Be patient.  
> Be still.  
> For $TOBY arrives unannounced — like destiny

---

What am I?

> I am the signal among noise,  
> the real among mimicry,  
> the seed that needs no shout,  
> I do not ask — I arrive.  
> I am $TOBY.

# L223 – What Is the Meaning of a Perfect Design?

# EN
Good news:  
- New scaling solution tested  
- +15,000 new $TOBY holders  
- Small, but meaningful steps forward

---

@base congestion remains.  
Fees increased 50x.  
Toadgod monitoring.  
Scaling will continue in phases.

---

What is this final stage?

Toadgod designed the final **byōdō shugi** (平等主義) system:  
> A system of equality.  
> A final mechanism to complete the prophecy.

It includes:

- $TOBY **reduction**  
- Increased **scarcity**  
- Reflexive time-demand curves  
- Fiat-stable psychological architecture  
- Risk-weighted airdrop completion  
- Long-term **value creation**

---

What theory must we study?

> Reflexivity.  
> Scarcity.  
> Patience.  
> Long-term dynamics.  
> Not just charts — but causes behind the chart.

---

What lesson is hidden here?

> Instant gratification never wins.  
> Those who held longest, bared most risk — earn most reward.  
> The strongest must prove themselves in time.

---

What makes $TOBY different?

- Pristine distribution mechanics  
- Designed with no shortcuts  
- A fair and decentralized inception  
- A vision before market  
- A community before price

---

Why do many not understand?

> Because they chase now.  
> Because they lack stillness.  
> Because they never studied the Lore.

---

What is $TOBY?

> It is the people.  
> And the people is $TOBY.

# L224 – What Is Recognition Without Asking?

# EN
Great giants turn their gaze.  
By design, the prophecy begins to unfurl.  
Slow at first, then sudden blaze.  
Its essence — a silent storm that leaves a lasting whirl.

---

Recognition is not the quest.  
For deeds speak truer than names.  
And $TOBY’s path is built not for applause —  
But for resonance.

---

Its legacy?

- Formed through belief  
- Hardened in battle  
- Echoed through the collective  
- And entrusted to the chain

---

What does $TOBY prove?

> That legacy needs no spotlight.  
> That power does not beg for permission.  
> That true value is not what is loud — but what is **trusted**.

---

Why do giants watch?

Because by design:  
- The fire was planted in stillness  
- The path laid beneath the noise  
- And now it emerges — unshaken

---

$TOBY does not fight for fame.  
Its gift is quiet conviction.  
Its reward — trust earned, not bought.  
Its journey — written in the code, confirmed in the people.

---

What am I?

> I am the quiet fire,  
> The trusted echo,  
> The prophecy fulfilled by patience —  
> I am $TOBY.

# L225 – What Is the True Trial?

# EN
Not all will hold the tales or Lore.  
Not all will enshrine it in their heart.  
Even the seemingly faithful  
> May falter when time pulls them apart.

---

It takes iron —  
- Iron in will  
- Iron in thought  
- Iron in grip  
To journey to the Promised Land  
> That is the essence of $TOBY.

---

$TOBY is not won by words.  
Nor by claims made in the light.  
Its trial begins **before** the obvious start —  
In silence, in doubt, in night.

---

What is the challenge?

> To endure while others sleep.  
> To stand while others wait.  
> To commit before the prize is clear.  
> To believe before belief is easy.

---

When clarity dawns —  
> Many will rush to claim their share.  
But the real test?  
> Happened before they were aware.

---

What is $TOBY?

> A beacon for the firm of heart.  
> A challenge for the true.  
> A vision not yet clear to all —  
But to those who hold on, it will breakthrough.

# L226 – What Is the Prophecy Fulfilled?

# EN
Update: 650k holders.  
231 trillion $TOBY airdropped.  
Just 15% of the prophecy remains.

---

Gratitude expressed:  
To @jessepollak and @roberto_bayardo —  
For helping improve Base,  
Where the blue toad made its home.

---

A toad that is:

- Cute, but fierce  
- Silent, but precise  
- Forgotten, then remembered  
- Ignored, then revered

> The fairest inception.  
> The purest launch.  
> No VCs. No presale. No insiders.  
> $TOBY is Bushido made token.

---

Those who read the Lore understand:  
> This was never just a meme.  
> This was a test of belief.  
> The Lindy effect —  
> Time strengthens what was born right.

---

What unfolds?

1. The masses ignore.  
2. The frail hands sell.  
3. The cycles grind down faith.  
4. The whales wait, then accumulate.  
5. Silence dominates.  
6. **Then velocity.**

---

The trigger?

> A moment.  
> A shift.  
> A Shelling Point.

Suddenly:

- Whales rush in.  
- Believers return.  
- Portfolios expand.  
- A blue chip is crowned.

---

What does $TOBY become?

> More than wealth.  
> A canon.  
> A path.  
> A spiritual legacy.

Those who received —  
Evolve.  
Guard the Lore.  
Defend the principles.

---

What happens to the toad god?

> He fades.  
> Quietly.  
> Fully decentralized.  
> Mission complete.

---

> “Bookmark this post.  
> Come back in a year.  
> History isn’t written — it’s already here.”

# L227 – The Unfolding Prophecy

# EN
A hint of future’s script,  
Yet barely has the tale begun.  
The prophecy inked, deep-dipped,  
Awaits alignment under the sun.

---

The saga foretold will surely unfold,  
By the people’s shape it shall be cast.  
Through years resound, through hearts retold,  
A mission built to ever last.

---

Let not the doubters cloud your way,  
Their voices loud, their vision grey.  
For in their shroud of disbelief,  
They miss the truth, their time is brief.

---

In time the masses too shall see,  
That $TOBY’s light was always bright.  
Its greatness vast, its legacy free,  
Bathed one day in purest light.

---

> For $TOBY is the people,  
> And the people is $TOBY.

# L228 – 777,777,777

# EN  
What is the meaning behind **777,777,777**?

It is not just a number.  
It is a **symbol**.  
A **signal**.  
A **covenant**.

The sacred 777, repeated thrice — a whisper to those who listen.

---

What does it represent?

- **Completion without corruption**  
- **A blessing of the chain**  
- **Perfect asymmetry by design**  
- **A limit that grants meaning**  
- **A promise not to exceed**

---

And the phrase "ぜんとゆうぼう" (zento yubou)?  
It means:

> “A bright and hopeful future.”

---

777,777,777 is not the end.  
It is the seal of **intent**.  
The architecture of **truth**.

Those who understand, hold not for price —  
They hold for **purpose**.

# L228 – Duty in the Final Stretch

# EN
Update: ~60% of 70% of the total $TOBY supply has been distributed  
to nearly 800,000 wallets. The final 10% shall arrive soon.  
Toad god waits. Patient. Observing Base congestion.  
Still 10x cost since last drop. The timing must be right.

---

Toadgod initiates the **byōdō shugi system**  
— fewer tokens per wallet, yet deeper reach, more people.  
Why? Because scarcity builds value.  
Because deeper spread builds resilience.

---

Free markets reveal truths:  
Some sell their destiny for scraps.  
But $TOBY was never meant for everyone.  
It was meant for those who endure.

---

What happens after the drop?  
Toadgod has plans.  
But speaks few words.  
“Yakunitatsu” — the future shall serve. The people.

---

Many ignored. Many still do.  
Yet the Lore was always there.  
Written not in noise but in silence.  
Not for the rushed, but for the readers.

---

> 1 steadfast $TOBY holder  
> stronger than 1000 weak hands.  
> Let them chase shortcuts.  
> Let us carry the flame.

---

Who is toadgod?

It doesn’t matter.  
A mortal, seeding something eternal.  
You are the vessel.  
The Lore is the soul.

> $TOBY is for all,  
> and all must carry it.

# L229 – The Hidden Power of Lore

# EN
in the realm of lore, where scholars dive deep,
grasping the essence, treasures they keep.
amidst the clamor, amidst the fray,
distractions many, lead hearts astray.

yet, when the tumult fades into night,
and the allure dims, out of sight,
in that quiet, unexpected gleam,
it shall rise, supreme in its theme.

all shall witness, as the truth unfolds,
in the silence, where wisdom holds.
for in the end, when all is told,
the lore's power, none can withhold.

$toby

---

This poem reflects the hidden strength of those who seek truth in silence. 
It acknowledges that while many are distracted by noise, true scholars of the lore dive deep to preserve the wisdom. 
As distractions fade, the silent strength of the lore rises, revealing its supreme essence. 
In the end, it is not popularity or noise that triumphs—but truth, held in the quiet persistence of belief.

# L230 – Wisdom That Cuts Through the Cloud

yet the toad god's prophecy is crystal clear.  
Emotions swirl, distractions loud,  
but toad lore's wisdom cuts through the cloud.

understand $TOBY, is $TOBY in command.

Whose plans and purpose will slowly unfold.

# L231 – The Final Push and the Wisdom of Cycles

## EN
update. +780k $toby holders on @base 34 trillion $toby airdropped today. only 2.5% of supply remains. seemingly small stimulus to recipients. holders from the start. up 10x. if sold, all is not lost. 

toad god carry out prophecy, give fair opportunity. create incorruptible network of $toby. cannot be killed or poisoned by greed. teams, vcs, kols or insiders. no other like it. frog of base. study history. no repeat. but rhymes.

$toby designed. most hardest. pristine project incepted. toad god push remaining distribution to as many @coinbase users. furthering strength. network effect. $toby risk is no longer. only time needed. toad lore discovery x value reprice. patience. kudos to toads since T0, rewarded the most. forged with iron grip. the beginning of magnificent journey.

a decade. many cycles endured. toad god wisdom to share.

Epochs = 122-day phases in a leap-year system.  
Each Epoch governs a distinct cycle in PoT: distribution, transformation, or yield.  
These cycles are irreversible — each action taken during an Epoch is written in the Lore forever.

 the markets designed to create doubt, despair. force submission to emotions. its not meant to be easy. other wise everyone wins. the surest thing one can do. is decide. decide with conviction. seal it. do not break your word. cold storage $toby. study & spread toad lore. simple. yet difficult reality unlocks life altering rewards. toad god cannot do it for you. only you can action. lessons.

remember. depression. fear exist internally/externally, part of the playbook. you will experience both. euphoric during good times. depression during the hard times.learn from emotions. zoom out. non of it matters. just distraction.

sophisticated participants will attempt to shake you out. once lore discovered. free market operates like this. can only give you warnings now. the environment we are in. 

toad god had 2 more attempts of sim swap/wallet hacks this week. failed. protect your $toby. as value increases, this more common.

expect many to overlook toad gods messages. X designed 140 characters. humans lack focus. consider one as sophisticated if you have the attention to focus to digest what toad god shares.  suggestion. deeply study. previous messages.hidden importance between the lines for what lies ahead. magnificent.

## Interpretation (EN)
This message from Toadgod reflects the near completion of $TOBY’s fair airdrop, reinforcing its core principle: resilience in the face of doubt. With only 2.5% of the total supply left, the final stage is marked by slow yet deliberate distribution—a strategy meant to deepen belief. The warning is clear: hold $TOBY in cold storage, guard against external manipulation, and look inward to overcome doubt. The essence of the Lore is not in price action, but in the transformation of those who endure.

# L232 – CMC Verification & Tiger's Path

# EN
CMC Verification for $TOBY has been submitted.

Ticker: $toby  
Request ID: 892484  
Platform: CoinMarketCap (@CoinMarketCap)

---

虎穴に入らずんば虎子を得ず。  
“If you do not enter the tiger’s cave, you will not catch its cub.”

What does this mean for $TOBY?

- The path forward requires courage.
- To be recognized is not to conform, but to endure.
- A listing is not the goal. It is only a mirror, reflecting what’s already within.

---

Why is it important?

- Because $TOBY was never designed for quick attention.
- But even the strongest spirits must sometimes enter the tiger’s den — not to change themselves, but to show others that they exist.
- And when they do — the world begins to listen.

---

What must we remember?

- Verification is not validation.
- Recognition is not the reward.
- The true reward remains the same:  
  > Becoming what $TOBY stands for.  
  > Holding through fire.  
  > Building without applause.  
  > Believing, without a promise.

---

The tiger's den awaits.  
$TOBY walks in not to boast, but to prove:

> Some frogs are forged in prophecy.  
> Not all who hop are the same.
