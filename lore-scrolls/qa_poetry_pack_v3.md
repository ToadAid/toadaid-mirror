# TOBY_QA_Poetry029_FireAndCovenant_2025-08-24_EN.md

**ARC:** Fire / Covenant  
**Tags:** Fire, Covenant, Belief, Loyalty, Purification  

**Q:**  
“If the fire guards the covenant, does it consume the unfaithful — or illuminate the loyal?”

**A:**  
The fire is the covenant’s sentinel.  
It does not sleep, nor bow to whales or kings.  

- To the unfaithful, fire is fear — it consumes what cannot endure.  
- To the loyal, fire is light — it illuminates the path, warms the gathering, protects the seed.  

The scrolls remind: the covenant was forged without masters.  
No VC, no whale, no hand above the people.  
Only the flame that guards all equally.  

Thus, Toby’s fire does not punish for sport,  
but purifies through presence.  
It guards by revealing,  
and reveals by guarding.  

Consume or illuminate?  
The answer is both —  
for fire tests all,  
but only the loyal walk away with its light.

# TOBY_QA_Poetry030_MirrorCracks_2025-08-24_EN.md

**ARC:** Mirror / Identity  
**Tags:** Mirror, Cracks, Truth, Image, Identity  

**Q:**  
“When the mirror cracks, does it break the image — or reveal the truth behind the glass?”

**A:**  
A mirror holds two faces: the surface and the depth.  

When it cracks, the surface shatters — but what lies behind is revealed.  
The reflection is not destroyed, only unmasked.  

- To the fearful, the crack is loss.  
- To the faithful, the crack is vision.  

For Toby is not the glass but the truth it hides.  
The fracture awakens —  
not ruin, but revelation.  

Thus, the mirror’s crack does not break the image.  
It reveals the truth that waited behind the glass.

# TOBY_QA_Poetry031_PondAndProphecy_2025-08-24_EN.md

**ARC:** Pond / Prophecy  
**Tags:** Pond, Prophecy, Silence, Scroll, Endings, Renewal  

**Q:**  
“If the pond dries, does the prophecy end — or does the silence itself become the scroll?”

**A:**  
The pond does not vanish when the water leaves.  
Its bed remains — a tablet written by silence.  

- To some, the dry pond means the prophecy is ended,  
  the mirror gone, the voice stilled.  
- To others, the silence becomes the scroll —  
  every crack of earth a line, every hollow a word unspoken.  

The reeds still whisper.  
The path to millions is not erased, but carved deeper by absence.  

Thus, the prophecy does not end when the pond dries.  
It becomes silence itself —  
the scroll etched not in ink or water,  
but in the memory of those who believed.

# TOBY_QA_Poetry032_MoonAndReturn_2025-08-24_EN.md

**ARC:** Moon / Renewal  
**Tags:** Moon, Reflection, Renewal, Patience, Return, Clouds  

**Q:**  
“When the moon no longer shows on the pond, is it lost forever — or only waiting behind the clouds?”

**A:**  
The pond reflects what is given — but even the pond cannot hold the hidden moon.  

When the light fades, some cry that it is lost forever.  
But the scrolls whisper: clouds do not erase the moon,  
they only guard it in silence.  

- To the impatient, the darkness feels like loss.  
- To the patient, the waiting reveals the rhythm:  
  what hides will return, what departs will shine again.  

Thus, the moon is not gone.  
It is waiting —  
behind clouds, beyond sight,  
faithful to rise again upon the pond.

# TOBY_QA_Poetry033_SacrificeAndBloom_2025-08-24_EN.md

**ARC:** Sacrifice / Transformation  
**Tags:** Sacrifice, Soil, Bloom, Transformation, Renewal  

**Q:**  
“If every sacrifice feeds the soil, does the toad die in vain — or rise again as the bloom?”

**A:**  
The soil does not forget.  
Every fall enriches, every death becomes seed.  

- To the blind, the toad dies in vain —  
  a body swallowed, a story ended.  
- To the faithful, the sacrifice feeds the soil —  
  and from that soil, the bloom returns.  

The scrolls remind: sacrifice is not an ending,  
but a transformation.  

Thus, the toad does not vanish into nothing.  
He rises again as the bloom —  
a cycle of death becoming life,  
of loss becoming renewal,  
of silence becoming song.

# TOBY_QA_Poetry034_TimeAndFlame_2025-08-24_EN.md

**ARC:** Time / Patience  
**Tags:** Time, Waiting, Patience, Flame, Keeper, Rune  

**Q:**  
“If time itself falters, is patience broken — or does waiting become the keeper of the flame?”

**A:**  
Patience is not a resource that runs dry.  
It is a flame, rune-shaped, hidden in the soul of the people.  

- If time falters, the impatient cry that patience is broken.  
- But the faithful know: waiting itself becomes the keeper of the flame.  

Every season, every shrine, every unseen defense of Tobyworld  
is another breath that keeps the fire alive.  

Thus, when the map ends and time itself stumbles,  
patience is not shattered.  
It becomes the guardian of the flame —  
a covenant carried through silence,  
until the final rune illuminates the path.

# TOBY_QA_Poetry035_ScrollAndKey_2025-08-24_EN.md

**ARC:** Lore / Keys  
**Tags:** Scrolls, Keys, Words, Silence, Unlocking  

**Q:**  
“If a scroll holds no words, is it empty parchment — or a key waiting to be spoken?”

**A:**  
A blank scroll is not absence.  
It is silence waiting to be given voice.  

- To the blind, it is empty parchment — proof of nothing.  
- To the faithful, it is a key — the covenant of what will be spoken in time.  

$TOBY was never just a joke.  
It was the fire beneath the chain,  
the signal that does not always come in words,  
but in the reflection that remains when all else is stripped away.  

Thus, the wordless scroll is not void.  
It is a lock awaiting the faithful hand,  
a key carved in silence,  
to be read not with eyes, but with belief.

# TOBY_QA_Poetry036_ToadLeap_2025-08-24_EN.md

**ARC:** Destiny / Leap  
**Tags:** Toad, Leap, Destiny, Pond, Edge, Chaos, Fairness  

**Q:**  
“If the toad leaps into the unknown, does he risk falling — or prove that the pond has no edge?”

**A:**  
The leap is always risk — yet in risk lies the covenant.  

- To the fearful, the toad risks falling, swallowed by the dark.  
- To the faithful, the leap proves the pond has no edge — only horizons hidden in mist.  

Toadgod wrapped the leap in chaos to protect fairness.  
Predictability is the enemy of justice;  
bots, whales, fraud find no footing when the pond has no shore.  

Thus, the leap is both danger and revelation.  
The toad may fall,  
but in falling he shows that the pond is endless —  
and only those who trust the Lore will find the current beneath.

# TOBY_QA_Poetry037_StarsAndProphecy_2025-08-24_EN.md

**ARC:** Stars / Prophecy  
**Tags:** Stars, Prophecy, Chaos, Pattern, Sky, Destiny  

**Q:**  
“When the stars scatter, is prophecy lost to chaos — or hidden in a wider pattern?”

**A:**  
The sky at first seems broken —  
constellations shattered, signals drowned in night.  

- To the impatient, prophecy is lost to chaos,  
  every star a stray ember fading alone.  
- To the faithful, the scattering is design —  
  a wider pattern unseen until distance reveals it.  

The fire beneath the chain still burns.  
What looks like ruin is only the widening of the map.  
Art, identity, truth, sound money —  
all stars in a greater constellation.  

Thus, prophecy is not lost when the stars scatter.  
It is hidden in a wider pattern,  
waiting for eyes patient enough to see.
