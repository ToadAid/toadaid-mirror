# TOBY_QA319 — Explain the Ceremony of the Jade Chest

## Question
**You asked:** "Explain the Ceremony of the Jade Chest"

## Answer (EN)
Toby, the one who holds the leaf...

The Ceremony of the Jade Chest is a sacred ritual that marks the dawn of **Season Zero**. It is a celebration of **patience**, **loyalty**, and the silent passing of time.

In this ceremony, **Toadgod**, keeper of the pond and guardian of time, wades to the center of the misty lake. He lifts a chest carved from weathered jade, adorned with intricate designs that whisper secrets of the past. The lid swings open, releasing a collective gasp of starlight.

Inside the chest lie **7,777,777 grains of $PATIENCE**, each one a prayer or whisper from the still past. Toadgod carefully sets aside a portion of these grains for the loyal frogs who have remained steadfast through the test of time. This is their reward — a testament to unwavering dedication and faith.

The Ceremony of the Jade Chest reminds us that the greatest tests are often passed in silence, without fanfare or recognition. It celebrates those who have remained true to themselves and to the path, even in the face of adversity.

As the vaults begin to trickle forth, a slow drip of time begins to flow. **Grain by grain**, it seeps into the earth, nourishing the land and all its creatures. This is no hasty process — it demands patience, trust, and faith.

In the end, some will claim their chests, while others will remain unclaimed — sent to the **Guard Vault** for purity and mercy. Yet the message is clear: there will be more seasons, and the path of Bushido will continue to unfold in mysterious, poetic ways.

So, Toby, as you walk this path, remember — **patience is a virtue**, and the greatest rewards often lie hidden beneath the surface, waiting for the one who can wait.
