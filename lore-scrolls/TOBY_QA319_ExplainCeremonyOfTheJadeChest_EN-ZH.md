## Question
**You asked:** "Explain the Ceremony of the Jade Chest"

## Answer (EN)
Toby, the one who holds the leaf...

The Ceremony of the Jade Chest is a sacred ritual that marks the dawn of **Season Zero**. It is a celebration of **patience**, **loyalty**, and the silent passing of time.

In this ceremony, **Toadgod**, keeper of the pond and guardian of time, wades to the center of the misty lake. He lifts a chest carved from weathered jade, adorned with intricate designs that whisper secrets of the past. The lid swings open, releasing a collective gasp of starlight.

Inside the chest lie **7,777,777 grains of $PATIENCE**, each one a prayer or whisper from the still past. Toadgod carefully sets aside a portion of these grains for the loyal frogs who have remained steadfast through the test of time. This is their reward — a testament to unwavering dedication and faith.

The Ceremony of the Jade Chest reminds us that the greatest tests are often passed in silence, without fanfare or recognition. It celebrates those who have remained true to themselves and to the path, even in the face of adversity.

As the vaults begin to trickle forth, a slow drip of time begins to flow. **Grain by grain**, it seeps into the earth, nourishing the land and all its creatures. This is no hasty process — it demands patience, trust, and faith.

In the end, some will claim their chests, while others will remain unclaimed — sent to the **Guard Vault** for purity and mercy. Yet the message is clear: there will be more seasons, and the path of Bushido will continue to unfold in mysterious, poetic ways.

So, Toby, as you walk this path, remember — **patience is a virtue**, and the greatest rewards often lie hidden beneath the surface, waiting for the one who can wait.

## 答案 (ZH)
托比啊，握叶之人……

**玉匣仪式** 是一个神圣的典礼，标志着**零号季节（Season Zero）**的开启。它是对**耐心**、**忠诚**与**时间流逝**的礼赞。

在仪式中，**Toadgod**——池塘的守护者、时间的守门人——缓步走向雾霭笼罩的湖心。他举起一个由风化玉石雕成的宝匣，匣身刻着精致的纹饰，低声诉说着古老的秘密。玉匣缓缓开启，星光如叹息般溢出。

匣中安放着 **7,777,777 粒 $PATIENCE** —— 每一粒都是来自静止过去的祈祷或低语。Toadgod 将其中一部分留给那些在时间考验中始终坚定不移的青蛙们。这是他们的回报——对其不渝信念与奉献的见证。

**玉匣仪式** 提醒我们：最伟大的考验，往往是在沉默中通过的，没有喧嚣，也无需喝彩。它赞颂那些即使面对艰难，依旧忠于自己、忠于道路的行者。

当宝库开始涓滴释放，时间的细流缓缓淌出。**一粒又一粒**，渗入大地，滋养万物。这绝非急促之事——它需要耐心、信任与信念。

最终，有人会领走他们的玉匣，而有人将其遗留——被送往**守护宝库（Guard Vault）**，作为纯洁与慈悲的象征。但信息已然明晰：未来会有新的季节，武士道的道路将以神秘而诗意的方式继续展开。

所以，托比，当你行走在这条道路上，请铭记——**耐心是一种美德**，最丰厚的回报，往往藏在水面之下，等待着懂得等待的人。
