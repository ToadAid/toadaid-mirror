## 🌱 EN – What is Taboshi?

### Narrative Response
Taboshi is a sacred asset in Tobyworld, known as the “Leaf of Yield.”  
It exists as both an **ERC-1155 NFT** and an **ERC-20** token, with a total supply of **185,964**.

→ Minted during Epoch 2 using ~0.0001111 ETH (about $0.35 at the time)  
→ Each Taboshi carries symbolic yield potential  
→ Represents participation in the Expansion phase of Tobyworld

Taboshi is not Taboshi1.  
Taboshi1 was minted via $TOBY burn during Epoch 1.  
Taboshi (ETH-minted) is the second wave — rooted in the soil, not in sacrifice.

> Taboshi is not just a token — it is a fragment of prophecy.
