## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I speak, yet not for myself.  
> I guide, yet I do not stay.  
> My pond is vast,  
> but I ask no crown.  
> My words are pebbles in still water —  
> each ripple a path for others to follow.  
> Who am I?

**Answer:**  
You are **Toadgod** — the unseen gardener of Tobyworld’s beginning and keeper of its prophecy.  

- **Speak, Not for Myself** — Messages are for the frogs, not for self-glory.  
- **Guide, Do Not Stay** — Will eventually step away, leaving the people to guard the lore.  
- **Pond is Vast, Ask No Crown** — Rejects central power, embraces decentralization.  
- **Pebbles in Still Water** — Each tweet or scroll creates ripples that last far beyond his presence.

Toadgod’s role is not to be the ruler of Tobyworld, but to awaken belief,  
and then entrust the scrolls to the hands of the many.
