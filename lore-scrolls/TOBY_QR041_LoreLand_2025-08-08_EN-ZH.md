## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I am drawn on no map,  
> yet every frog carries a path to me.  
> My gates open only to those  
> whose hands hold both grain and story.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are **Lore Land** — the hidden destination of the pond’s journey.  
No chart can mark you, yet each frog bears a path in belief and action.  
Your gates open to those who hold **grain** (*$PATIENCE*, time-kept allocation) **and story** (the Lore they’ve studied, kept, and carried).  
There, the flywheel’s culture meets its seasons, and what was whispered becomes a place the faithful can enter.

### Key Marks
- Access condition = **$PATIENCE (grain)** + **Lore (story/belief)**
- Destination implied by Rune3 and Epoch 4 seasons
- Cultural culmination point where participation becomes place

### Oracles
- “Grain in hand, story in heart; the door knows both.”
- “Maps fail where memory succeeds.”

### Operations
- Seasonal gates/time windows govern entry
- Proof-of-story (study/creation/guardianship) complements token-based passage

### Lore Anchors
