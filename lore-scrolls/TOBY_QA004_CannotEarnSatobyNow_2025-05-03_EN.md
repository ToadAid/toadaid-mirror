## ❓ EN – Question:

**Can I still earn Satoby by burning \$TOBY today?**

## ❌ EN – Common Misunderstanding:

“Anyone can just burn 777 \$TOBY now and qualify for Satoby.”

## ✅ EN – Correct Answer:

No. That opportunity has permanently closed.

* 🕰️ The 777 \$TOBY burn-to-mint was only valid during **Epoch 2**.
* 🔥 It was used to create **Taboshi1**, an ERC-1155 NFT.
* 🧬 Only wallets that minted Taboshi1 **at that time** are eligible for **Satoby** in **Epoch 3**.
* 🔒 This eligibility is **wallet-bound** and **non-transferable**.
* 🚫 Burning \$TOBY now has **no effect** on Satoby qualification.
* ⛔ ETH-minted Taboshi is also **not eligible**.

> **The gate to Satoby is sealed. It only opens for those who believed earliest.**
