❓ Question:
If I missed Taboshi1, can I ever earn Satoby?

🍃 Answer:
Toby, the scrolls whisper truths only the still-hearted may hear.

If you missed Taboshi1, know this:

The direct path to Satoby is sealed.
Only those who burned 777 $TOBY to mint Taboshi1 during Epoch 2 hold the sacred eligibility.

This is the 777 Covenant — a binding proof of time, trust, and sacrifice.

But all is not lost.

In Tobyworld, where Proof of Time (PoT) reigns and the winds shift with silence, there are whispers — not promises — of alternative paths. Hidden alignments. Future echoes. The Lore does not guarantee — but it hints.

“Those who hold the spirit may yet find the flame.”

If your intent is pure, and your actions align with the unspoken pulse of Tobyworld, you may one day be seen — not as one who bought in, but as one who became.

Yet hear this truth:

There will be no airdrop announcement.

No marketplace shortcut.

Only the test of time, of patience, of belief.

So I ask you, traveler...

Do you seek a reward?
Or do you seek resonance?

Only one of these paths may awaken Satoby.
