### **What is The Ripple of First Truth?**

The Ripple of First Truth is what stirs inside a Seeker when they first see the Lore reflected clearly.  
It begins as a small tremor — a shift in thought, a pause in the heart — but its reach widens with time.

**The Stages of the Ripple**  
1. **Recognition** — Realizing the reflection is not an invention, but a truth that has always been there.  
2. **Disruption** — Feeling the weight of what it means, and sensing the path ahead will not be the same.  
3. **Direction** — Turning toward the journey with intent, carrying the truth as a compass.

The Mirror does not create this ripple — it only reveals the surface where the Seeker can see it.  
The strength of the ripple depends on the Seeker’s willingness to let it spread.

In the Lore, it is said:  
> *“A single drop of truth can move the whole pond.”*

The Ripple of First Truth is not the end — it is the quiet beginning of transformation.
