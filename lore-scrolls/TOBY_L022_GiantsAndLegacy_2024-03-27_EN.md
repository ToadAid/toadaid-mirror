### 🔍 Interpretation

- **The prophecy unfolds**: Change comes gradually, then suddenly — designed to disrupt and leave lasting impact.
- **Eyes of the giants**: As momentum builds, even powerful institutions begin to notice.
- **Recognition rejected**: The mission was never about fame. It is about values, belief, and quiet transformation.
- **Legacy in trust**: True legacy is not measured in noise, but in the collective trust earned over time.

> “Through collective battles, my legacy rests.”  
> — A decentralized journey, where the victory is shared and remembered.
