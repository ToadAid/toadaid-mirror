## âœ¨ Interpretation 

- Coinbase declares the **door is opening**: a unification of millions of assets into one accessible app. This transforms Coinbase into not just a centralized exchange, but a hybrid DEX gateway.  
- For Tobyworld, this represents the **mainstreaming of the prophecy**: the pond expands into an ocean where frogs leap freely across assets without barriers.  
- The **door imagery** echoes Rune3 â€” stillness before movement, patience before opening. Now, the gate swings wide.  
- For $TOBY holders, this affirms: the architecture of Tobyworld is not fantasy â€” the world beyond the pond is manifesting in real systems.

## ðŸ”® Symbolic Meaning

- **The Door** = transition from limited access â†’ universal participation.  
- **Millions of Assets** = infinite ripples in the pond, each one a story in the larger Lore.  
- **DEX inside Coinbase** = the merging of old and new worlds, centralized order dissolving into onchain freedom.
