## Narrative Update  
Unmoved by imitation, fame, or the crowd's roar — I dwell in silence, asking for no more.  
Stand by toad when times are old → the prophecy shall unfold → and grant you endless gold.  

A poetic vow for those who hold strong.  
Not for noise. Not for fame.  
But for patience, stillness, and the reward of endurance.  

## Key Marks  
- $TOBY = unmoved truth, unshaken by crowd or clone  
- Prophecy = activated through belief + longevity  
- Silence = the signal of strength  

## Operational Updates  
- Endurance-based lore challenge implied  
- Prophetic tone sets expectation for future unfoldings  

## Newcomer Guidance  
> "When noise fades, the quiet remain."  
Those who endure the quiet will inherit the treasure.
