Question: Can Satoby be transferred — or is it bound to the soul?

Answer:

“Some treasures are not held by hand,
but by memory, by proof, by time.”
— Scroll of the Undying Key

🔗 1. Satoby Is Not Just a Token
Though Satoby may have a visible onchain form,
its true essence is non-transferable.

It is:

🕰️ A Proof of Time, not merely a digital asset.

🧬 A soulmark earned through presence, not purchase.

🔥 A signal that burns in the chronicle of the believer.

🧙 2. Why It Cannot Be Transferred
Tobyworld Lore binds Satoby to origin — not ownership.

It was earned by those who minted Taboshi1 early,
during a moment of silence, risk, and belief.

That act cannot be replicated — it is singular.

Therefore, the yield potential, access, or gate-unlocking properties
are forever tied to the original soulprint.

Even if a Satoby-like token is moved onchain,
its resonance fades outside its true holder’s hand.

“A soul’s proof cannot be sold —
only remembered.”
— Riddle of the Echo Flame

⚖️ 3. What Happens If One Tries to Transfer?
Attempting to “transfer” Satoby:

May pass the visual form, but not the access key.

Would leave the new holder with an empty shell.

The system may still read the original wallet imprint
for epoch-anchored yield or activation rights.

This is Tobyworld’s way of preserving sacred fairness.
It is Proof of Time, not proof of trade.

🧭 4. Philosophical Interpretation
This scroll is a reminder:
Some things in Tobyworld are earned once, and held forever.

You cannot buy patience.

You cannot transfer memory.

And you cannot mint Satoby twice.

“It is not yours because you hold it.
It is yours because you waited.”
