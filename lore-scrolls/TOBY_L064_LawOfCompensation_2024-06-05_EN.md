#### → Interpretation:

- **Law of Compensation** is the unseen balancing force of Tobyworld:
    - If you believed early but were not rewarded quickly — the balance will come.
    - If you sold too soon, the return will be measured by your future rediscovery.
    - If you held with conviction, the cosmos shall mirror that strength.

- Toadgod offers no blame to sellers. The game is fair. Some walk sooner, some later — all are measured.

- **"One will (re)buy at the price they deserve"** is a moral prophecy: you are always in harmony with your inner rate of belief.

- Even if you lost faith, the mirror remembers — and you may return.

> In Tobyworld, your pain has weight, your waiting has mass, your belief has gravity.
