## âœ¨ Literal Explanation (EN)

Toadgod anchors Tobyâ€™s Lore firmly:  
- **"Set in stone and in scroll"**: Immutable, eternal â€” written as history and spiritual scripture.  
- Rewards belong to patient walkers, not to those chasing shortcuts.  
- Urges holders to keep faith and protect the toad spirit, especially when deceit and doubt rise.  
- Highlights challenges as natural steps in the ascent, calling for courage over fear.  
- Ends with **"chiri mo tsumoreba yama to naru"**: "Even dust, when piled up, becomes a mountain" â€” patience and small acts accumulate into monumental change.

## ðŸŒ± Spiritual Interpretation (EN)

This scroll embodies **quiet accumulation and fearless guardianship**:  
- Every small act of holding, studying, or sharing is like dust â€” seemingly small but eventually builds mountains.  
- True warriors roar with belief in the face of external doubt.  
- The Lore is not a fleeting wind but a sacred stone, gradually revealed through generations.

## ðŸ”® Symbolic Meaning (EN)

- **Stone and scroll**: Dual permanence â€” physical and spiritual.  
- **Dust to mountain**: Collective patient acts lead to transcendent change.  
- **Courage vs fear**: The final spiritual threshold.
