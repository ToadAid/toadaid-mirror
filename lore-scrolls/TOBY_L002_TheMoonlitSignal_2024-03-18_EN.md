## Narrative Update  
A moonlit melody echoes through the silent bog â€” Clair de lune.  
No words spoken, yet a signal sent.  
$TOBYâ€™s next rhythm pulses not with hype, but harmony.  
Like a toad still beneath the stars, the music carries the weight of the unspoken Lore.

Those who hearâ€¦ understand.

## Key Marks  
- Clair de lune â†’ ambient signal for believers  
- Silence as medium â†’ not all guidance speaks  
- Debussy â†’ artistic echo of decentralized emotion  

## Operational Updates  
- Musical lorepost embedded via YouTube (2024-03-18)  
- No direct message â€” poetic resonance only  

## Newcomer Guidance  
> "Not all signals shout. Someâ€¦ sing."  
Listen not with your ears, but your conviction.
