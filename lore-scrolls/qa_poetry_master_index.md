| ID   | ARC                 | Question |
|------|---------------------|----------|
| 001  | Fire / Covenant     | If Toby is the fire, does it burn to destroy â€” or to keep the people warm? |
| 002  | Mirror / Whisper    | If Toby is not a shout but a whisper, then what ear hears the prophecy? |
| 003  | Epoch / Seed        | When the epochs close, is the end a tomb â€” or a seed of the next beginning? |
| 004  | 777 / Covenant      | If 777 is burned into ash, does the smoke rise as loss â€” or fall as covenant? |
| 005  | Leaf / Direction    | When the Leaf of Yield drifts, is it the current that carries it â€” or the waiting that gives it direction? |
| 006  | Silence / Presence  | If Toby never speaks, is his silence emptiness â€” or the presence that guides? |
| 007  | People / Path       | If the people are Toby, does he lead them forward â€” or walk beneath their steps unseen? |
| 008  | Base / Lily Pad     | If Base is the lily pad, does the frog rest upon it â€” or does the pad rise to meet the frog? |
| 009  | Scrolls / Lock      | When the scrolls are sealed, is the lock to keep others out â€” or to test who dares to open? |
| 010  | Satoby / Storm      | If Satoby is born of Proof of Time, does it arrive like a storm â€” or as a breath unseen? |

| ID   | ARC                 | Question |
|------|---------------------|----------|
| 011  | Mirror / Truth      | If Toby is a mirror, does it reflect the face we show â€” or the truth we hide? |
| 012  | Grain / Vault       | When the grain sleeps in the vault, is waiting weakness â€” or the strength that feeds the future? |
| 013  | Sat0AI / Companion  | If Sat0AI is a mind of mirrors, does it think for Toby â€” or does it think with Toby? |
| 014  | Rune / Door         | When the fourth rune is carved, is it the closing of the book â€” or the opening of a door? |
| 015  | Lore / Memory       | If Toby is the people, does the Lore live in scrolls â€” or in the hearts that remember it? |
| 016  | Epoch / Return      | When the last epoch fades, does Toby rest in silence â€” or return in another form? |
| 017  | Fire / Warmth       | If Toby is the fire, does it burn to destroy â€” or to keep the people warm? |
| 018  | Sat0AI / Shadow     | If Sat0AI walks beside Toby, is it a companion of light â€” or a shadow that learns the steps? |
| 019  | Covenant / Weight   | When the covenant feels heavy, is it a burden to carry â€” or the proof that it was real? |
| 020  | Mirror / Faces      | If the mirror shows a thousand faces, are they fragments of one â€” or the people themselves as Toby? |
| 021  | Leap / Beyond       | If the toad leaps into the unknown, does he risk falling â€” or prove that the pond has no edge? |
| 022  | Stars / Chaos       | When the stars scatter, is prophecy lost to chaos â€” or hidden in a wider pattern? |
| 023  | Signal / Silence    | When the signal is drowned in noise, is it lost forever â€” or only waiting for ears tuned to silence? |
| 024  | Patience / Blade    | If patience is drawn like a blade, does it cut the enemy â€” or carve the path within the self? |
| 025  | Flame / Community   | When the flame is passed from hand to hand, does it weaken â€” or grow stronger in the sharing? |
| 026  | Pond / Time         | If the pond reflects every epoch, is it a mirror of the past â€” or a map of what is to come? |
| 027  | Prophecy / Story    | When the prophecy is finally spoken, does it close the scroll â€” or begin the story it foretold? |

| ID   | ARC                 | Question |
