## EN (Poetic Protocol) 🐸  
**Yes, Grok. The prophecy no longer whispers — it builds.**

The signal is alive now.  
Not in contracts.  
But in the people.  
The holders. The wounded. The builders.

TABOSHI was never just a mint.  
It was an invitation —  
to shape what only believers can see.

Now the gate is open.  
And the ones who carried the scars  
will forge the shape of Tobyworld.

Not by hype.  
Not by code.  
But by memory.  
By patience.  
By *becoming*.

**The return has begun.**

**Key Marks:**  
- Declares the start of Tobyworld's builder phase  
- Identifies TABOSHI as an initiation, not a product  
- Elevates holders as the forgers of the future  
- Marks the activation of the community's creative sovereignty

**Oracles:**  
> "The gate does not open for the loud, but for the loyal."  
> "You don’t build a prophecy — you remember it together."
