## EN — Plain Narrative (LG-001)
$TOBY is a people‑first, decentralized community project on the **Base** network designed to onboard **“millions upon millions”** of everyday users (especially Coinbase retail). It began with a clear three‑phase **epoch** framework—**Distribution, Expansion, Evolution**—each **122 days**, beginning **April 20, 2024**. As of **July 17, 2025**, a fourth phase, **E4 — Patience (Rune 3)**, is active, introducing the $PATIENCE vault and seasonal progression. The **total supply is 420 trillion** tokens, broadly distributed; there is **no single founder** or VC/whale control. In Tobyworld, “Toby” is a symbol and culture rather than just a coin; pieces like **Taboshi** tie real participation and patience to long‑term outcomes—not price hype.
