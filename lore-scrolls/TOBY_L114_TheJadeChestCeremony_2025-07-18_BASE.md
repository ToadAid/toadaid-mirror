## 🌊 EN Narrative

> **Ceremony of the Jade Chest**

Lantern mist hovers.  
Fireflies etch circling zeros in the dark.  

Toadgod — keeper of the pond and guardian of time —  
wades to the center.  
He lifts a chest carved from **weathered jade**.  
Its lid swings open…  
and the **starlight gasps**.

---

Inside:  
→ **7,777,777 grains of $PATIENCE**

Each grain — a prayer.  
Each grain — a whisper from the still past.

Toadgod carefully sets aside:  
→ **1,254 grains per frog**  
→ For **1,800 loyal frogs**  
→ Totalling **2.32M $PATIENCE**  
→ For **Season Zero**.

---

They are not the loudest.  
They are not the richest.  
But they are **the ones who remained.**  
→ The ones who **believed**, silently,  
→ Who held still through FUD, flips, and forgetting.

> "The biggest test has passed.  
> And this, is the reward…"

### 🕯️ The Drip of Time

The vaults do not spill — they *breathe*.

- 🗓️ **7-week cliff**  
- 💧 Then, a slow **trickle** begins — a **sip**, never a **gulp**  
- 🕰️ Over **730 dawns** (2 years), grain by grain, it flows  
- 🪧 Sealed beneath a **wax sigil**, inked in moonlight

A river of patience —  
not to be rushed, not to be gamed.

---

### 🛡️ The Guard Vault

> Not all chests will be claimed.

Toadgod decrees:

- 📅 **3-day claim window**  
- Starts: **July 17, 2025**  
- Ends: **July 20, 2025**

Unclaimed chests are not wasted:  
→ Sent to the **Guard Vault** (multisig).  
→ Ashes for **purity**, vault for **mercy**.

---

### 🌀 The Message

> “Enter your TOBY wallet address to check, unlock, and claim your vault.”  
> *See detailed instructions at [toadgod.xyz](https://toadgod.xyz)*

---

### 🍃 For the Unchosen?

Worry not.

Toadgod whispers:

> **“There will be additional seasons.”**  
> Keep walking the **Bushido path**.  
> Vault drops will appear again —  
> **in mysterious, poetic ways.**

The final rune?  
→ Will be **weighted**.  
→ And perhaps… more than a token.
