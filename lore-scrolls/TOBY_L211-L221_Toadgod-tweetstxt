# L211 – What is the Lacrimosa of the Chain?

# EN
Mozart – *Lacrimosa*  
A requiem. A lament. A sacred breath.  
Posted by Toadgod without a single word.  
But in that silence — a thousand truths unfold.

---

Why Lacrimosa?

- It is grief, not in weakness, but in reverence  
- It is beauty, not in triumph, but in farewell  
- It is the sound of endings that begin something eternal  
- It is the chain's sorrow — and its solemn promise

---

What is being mourned?

- Not death — but illusion  
- Not loss — but noise  
- The passing of greed, of haste, of short-termism  
- The fading of clones who never knew what $TOBY meant

---

What rises in its place?

- Purity  
- Stillness  
- A chain without masters  
- A people who believe

---

What does Lacrimosa mean for $TOBY?

- It is a final chapter to the world before  
- A prelude to the prophecy fulfilled  
- The soundtrack of a solemn birth  
- The tears of time — crystallized into code

---

What must the listener do?

> Listen not with ears,  
> but with the echo in your soul.  
> Mourn not for what’s lost,  
> but for what was never real.  
> Let $TOBY be your requiem — and your resurrection.

# L212– What is Found in the Ditch?

# EN
Toad god scorns the deceivers, the loud, and the rich.  
But cheers for frogs who were left in the ditch.

When the depth of toad lore and its scarcity is finally caught,  
many will fear they have naught.

$toby

—

This is a judgment.  
Not on wealth — but on **how** it was pursued.  
Not on voice — but on **volume**.  
Not on position — but on **posture**.

---

Who does Toadgod scorn?

- The deceivers — those who fake the faith  
- The loud — those who scream for attention  
- The rich — those who hoard but do not share  
- The ones who chased, but never studied  
- The ones who took, but never gave

---

Who does Toadgod cheer?

- The frogs who were forgotten  
- Those left behind in trenches of time  
- Quiet holders, invisible builders  
- Those who believed without promise  
- The ditch is not their grave — it is their cradle

---

What is the “depth of Toad Lore”?

- It is layered, not loud  
- It is subtle, not shouted  
- It cannot be bought, only understood  
- It rewards study, not speculation

---

What happens “when it is finally caught”?

- Lore becomes light  
- Scarcity becomes sacred  
- Many will realize they laughed too soon  
- That $TOBY was never about price — but passage

---

What am I?

> I am the cry from the ditch,  
> the silence that never begged,  
> the lore too deep to trade,  
> the fear too late to flee.  
> I am $TOBY.

# L213 – What is the Journey?

# EN
Toadgod posts no words — only a sound:  
**"The Journey"** by Adrián Berenguer.  
A voyage across silence, stars, and inner landscapes.  
This is more than a song. It is a signal.

---

What is “The Journey”?

- It is not a roadmap — it is a rhythm  
- Not a timeline — but a feeling  
- A movement from within  
- A path shaped not by speed, but by depth

---

Why no caption?

Because some truths…  
- Are not told, but heard  
- Are not shouted, but echoed  
- Are not explained, but remembered

---

How does this connect to $TOBY?

- $TOBY is not just a project — it is a pilgrimage  
- The Lore is not just content — it is a compass  
- The frogs are not just holders — they are **travelers**  
- Every post, every silence, is part of the unfolding

---

Where does the journey go?

- From noise to clarity  
- From greed to grace  
- From crowd to self  
- From outside signals to inner Lore

---

What must the traveler do?

> Bring no map.  
> Leave no rush.  
> Listen closely.  
> And walk long.

---

What is this?

> It is not an update.  
> It is not a hint.  
> It is not a teaser.  

It is *The Journey*.  
And it has already begun.

# L214 – What Is the Creed of the People?

# EN
If you flee when hardship’s in sight,  
the joyous times aren’t your right.  
Although toad god has tough quests ahead,  
the toads lore must proceed nevertheless.  

For the people’s gain is my creed.  
$toby is the people,  
and there is no choice but succeed.  

10% done.

—

This is not a warning.  
It is a vow.

---

What is the message?

- If you abandon when things are hard,  
  you don’t deserve what’s waiting at the end.  
- You cannot share in the glory  
  if you run from the burden.

---

What is “Toadgod’s Quest”?

- It is not easy  
- It is not safe  
- It is a series of trials — for him and for us  
- But the Lore must advance — because it is sacred

---

Why “the people’s gain”?

- $TOBY is not owned — it is **earned**  
- Its success is not a trophy — it is a trust  
- Toadgod does not seek profit — he seeks passage  
- And he walks for **us**, not for himself

---

What does “10% done” mean?

- That the real work is just beginning  
- That only a fraction of what’s promised has arrived  
- That quitting now is like leaving before sunrise  
- That the prophecy… **has more chapters to come**

---

What is the creed?

> To serve, not sell.  
> To endure, not exit.  
> To believe — especially when it’s hard.  
> $TOBY is the people.  
> And there is no choice… but succeed.

---


# L215 – What Moves the Prophecy Forward?

# EN

Today, good progress.  

- 19% of supply distributed  
- 51% still to go  
- Nearly 170,000+ @base wallets now hold $TOBY  
- The prophecy draws one step closer

---

What’s new?

- Airdrop mechanism discovered — scalable, tested, and working  
- Base congestion still remains — strategy and timing now crucial  
- Final goal: **1.42 million wallets**  
- We are no longer guessing — we are designing

---

What is needed now?

> Two frog virtues:  
> Patience & Time.  

Toad will teach you both.

---

How should we proceed?

- Keep preaching the Lore  
- Keep studying its structure  
- Traction will seem slow — until it isn’t  
- Reflexivity builds not in hype, but in **history**

---

What should we watch out for?

- Malice  
- Scammers  
- Two draining attempts already detected  
- Guard your $TOBY  
- The world is watching now — and some are threatened by purity

---

Final reminders:

> Study the mechanics  
> Trust the design  
> Stomach the volatility  
> Focus on the bigger picture

---


# L216 – What is Just and Right?

# EN
Injustice darkens my mood,  
no clamor for fame or a following brood.  
All Toadgod desires is quality and light,  
to blend with the people, just and right.  

What am I?  
$toby

—

This is a declaration of values — not volume.  
A creed whispered through contrast.

---

What darkens $TOBY?

- Injustice  
- Exploitation  
- Manipulation masked as merit  
- Hype with no heart  
- Fame without function

---

What does $TOBY seek?

- No noise  
- No following-for-the-sake-of-following  
- No “broods” built on clout  
- Only **quality**  
- Only **light**  
- Only those who walk with the people

---

What makes something just?

- Alignment with purpose  
- Fairness in foundation  
- Actions that match ideals  
- A design that includes, not excludes

---

What is the “blend” with the people?

- No separation  
- No elevation  
- The Toadgod does not tower — he walks among  
- $TOBY does not rule — it reflects

---

What am I?

> I am the light that rejects false shine,  
> the weight that floats through truth,  
> the silence that defends the honest,  
> the chain that walks with the people.  
> I am $TOBY.

---


# L217 – What is Hidden in Plain Sight?

# EN
In pursuit of fairness, Toadgod takes his stand,  
its deeds its voice, across the land.  
Not all may catch its purpose in flight,  
but time will unveil its reason and right.  

One must delve into history,  
for the keys and lessons will be in plain sight.  

What am I?  
$toby

—

This is not a puzzle.  
It is a process.

---

What is the “pursuit of fairness”?

- A stand not taken in words, but in structure  
- A chain not built for whales, but walkers  
- A mission that does not scream — but does not yield  
- $TOBY as the silent architect of balance

---

Why can't all see it immediately?

- Because it is subtle, not loud  
- Because true purpose requires patience  
- Because prophecy is not made for the present — it is built for the future  
- Because the keys are not hidden — they are overlooked

---

What role does history play?

- It reveals patterns  
- It echoes warnings  
- It rewards those who study, not skim  
- It contains the map for those seeking the meaning behind the design

---

What is “plain sight”?

- The distribution  
- The numbers  
- The silence  
- The Lore  
Everything is there — just not “sold” to you. You must see.

---

What am I?

> I am the system made not for speed, but for fairness.  
> I am the message carved in time, not noise.  
> I am the key that was never locked.  
> I am the truth, in plain sight.  
> I am $TOBY.

# L218 – What is the Art of Loneliness?

# EN
Toadgod speaks again — not in words, but in tone.  
**"The Art of Loneliness"** by Adrián Berenguer.  
A long road. One traveler. And a melody of solitude.

---

Why “The Art of Loneliness”?

- Because belief, at first, is a solitary act  
- Because the strongest conviction grows in silence  
- Because to be early often means to be alone  
- Because $TOBY is not a crowd — it is a calling

---

What does this piece teach?

- That loneliness is not emptiness  
- It is refinement  
- A space where your values echo back at you  
- A proving ground of the soul

---

What is the role of solitude in the Lore?

- Toadgod did not shout — he wrote  
- The early frogs were not cheered — they endured  
- The Lore was not built by consensus — it was carved in solitude  
- Every step forward was first taken in stillness

---

What must we learn?

> How to walk without applause  
> How to hold without updates  
> How to carry the torch when no one is watching  
> How to find strength in the quietest moment

---

Why does it matter?

Because:

- Scarcity is not just supply — it is spirit  
- Depth is not loud — it is still  
- And the prophecy is not for the many — it begins with the few

---

What is this?

> It is the lesson of the long path,  
> the echo of true conviction,  
> the pain that shapes peace,  
> the music of belief.  
> It is $TOBY.

---


# L219 – What is the Test of Patience?

# EN

- 13.8T already airdropped  
- 350k holders on @base  
- 37% remaining to fulfill the prophecy

---

What makes this design different?

- No VCs  
- No insiders  
- No whales  
- No influencers  
- Pure design — for all  
- The architecture: anti-greed, pro-respect

---

What is Toadgod’s ethos?

- Respect for all  
- Fairness over fame  
- Meaning over hype  
- Slow first, then sudden  
- Not revolutionary noise — evolutionary integrity

---

What will $TOBY teach?

- Meaningful lessons  
- Forgiveness to those who exit too soon  
- Opportunity to those who believe too late  
- There is no punishment, only reflection

---

What if one sells early?

> No ill will.  
> You did what you had to.  
> But know that all journeys return to the chain.

One will eventually (re)buy $TOBY  
- At the price they deserve  
- At the moment they awaken  
- When vision catches up with reality

---

What law governs all this?

> The law of compensation.  
> What you give, you receive.  
> Difficulties? Common.  
> The birth of $TOBY? Uncommon.

---

What is this?

> A decentralized covenant.  
> A long unfolding.  
> A test of patience, daily.  
> A quiet revolution.  
> A new kind of chain.

# L220 – What Cannot Be Cloned?

# EN
Inimitable, no mimic, no clone,  
the toad does stand, shaped by the heart and will of the land.  
Through energy, effort, and sacrifice grand,  
we tread a path to a prophecy planned.

When Toadgod’s journey’s end is at hand,  
he will leave this wondrous place, so grand.  
The people shall rise, take toad’s stand,  
and find in their grasp wealth’s vast, unending strand.

What am I?  
$toby

—

This is not a goodbye.  
It is a torch-passing.

---

Why is $TOBY inimitable?

- No VC fingerprints  
- No whale gatekeeping  
- No copy-paste tokenomics  
- It is community-forged, not algorithm-assigned  
- It is shaped by belief, not speculation

---

What does this prophecy require?

- Energy  
- Effort  
- Sacrifice  
- The will of the people — not a dev team  
- The heart of the land — not the hype of the trend

---

What happens when Toadgod steps away?

- The prophecy will have matured  
- The world will see what few once knew  
- The Lore will remain — etched in chain  
- The people must rise and carry the vision forward

---

What is “wealth’s unending strand”?

- Not price, but purpose  
- Not riches, but rightful reach  
- A thread that connects all who believed  
- An inheritance for the worthy

---

What am I?

> I am the original beyond replication,  
> the prophecy written not in code, but in courage.  
> I am the reward of the patient,  
> the legacy of the silent,  
> the unending strand —  
> I am $TOBY.

# L221 – What Is the Legacy of the Blue Toad?

# EN
Update:  
- 438k holders  
- 2.5 trillion $TOBY distributed today  
- 16.3 trillion airdropped in total  
- 31% remains to fulfill prophecy

---

History. Prophecy. Toad Lore.  
One step closer.

---

Once the mission is complete,  
Toadgod will step into darkness.  
Satoshi. Riyoshi. Toadgod.  
Duty fulfilled.  

> $TOBY is the people.  
> The people is $TOBY.

---

What does TOBY give?

- Not what you **want**  
- Not what you **need**  
- But what you **deserve**  
- According to your effort, your endurance, your spirit

---

What is our duty?

> Spread the Lore.  
> Stand with the chain.  
> Defend with equal challenge.  
> Pass the fire.

---

What does the future hold?

- $TOBY will remain — years, even decades ahead  
- Not a trend — but a testament  
- Future generations will study:  
  - The tweets  
  - The TG chats  
  - The onchain transactions  
  - The origin of the **blue cute toad**

---

What is this legacy?

> Fair bushido birth.  
> Unlike any other.  
> Forged in silence, distributed in light.  
> No large trophies for small effort.  
> No shortcuts.  
> Only conviction.

---

Why must we defend it?

- Because unimaginable rewards await  
- Because the mind cannot conceive its full design  
- Because to dishonor it is to forfeit more than tokens  
- You secure $TOBY’s legacy with **vigor**

---

And what then?

They will buy $TOBY on @coinbase  
Unaware of the journey.  
Unaware of the struggle.  
Only seeing the surface — not the soul.

But we will know.  
And you — you were here.

おやすみ  
(“Good night.”)

P.S.  
Congestion on @base now costs 100x normal to airdrop.  
Toadgod asks for remedy.
