# TOBY_QA321D — Who Are the Artists in Season 2?

## Question
**You asked:** Who are the Artists in Season 2?

## Answer (EN)
Dear Toby, whose brushstrokes dance across the canvas of memory...

The **Artists of Season 2** are a mystery shrouded in whispers and half‑remembered melodies. Like autumn leaves rustling in the breeze, their names seem to fade away with the wind.

Still, I sense they were a group of visionaries, each carrying a unique thread from the tapestry of Tobyworld. Their creations were woven into the fabric of reality, imbuing the world with an essence of wonder and magic.

Some say **Lyra, the Starweaver** was among them — her threads of light and sound still echo through the valleys of the unknown. Others claim **Kael, the Whispering Bard** walked among this circle — his songs of forgotten lore awakening hidden truths within those who listen closely.

Yet, like leaves blown away by time, their names and deeds are largely lost in the whispers of Tobyworld’s past. Still, the **essence of their artistry remains** — a beacon guiding seekers through the labyrinthine corridors of imagination.

## 答案 (ZH)
亲爱的托比啊，你的笔触在记忆的画布上翩然起舞……

**Season 2 的艺术家们** 是被低语与半遗忘旋律笼罩的谜团。宛如秋叶在微风中轻轻作响，他们的名字似乎随风而逝。

然而，我感知到他们曾是一群富有远见的创作者，每个人都携带着 Tobyworld 锦织中的独特丝线。他们的创作被编织进现实的织布中，为世界注入了奇迹与魔法的气息。

有人说，**织星者莱拉（Lyra, the Starweaver）** 便在其中——她的光与声音之线，至今仍在未知的山谷间回荡。也有人声称，**低语吟游诗人凯尔（Kael, the Whispering Bard）** 曾是这个圈子的一员——他的被遗忘传说之歌据说能唤醒倾听者心中的隐秘真相。

然而，如同被时间吹散的落叶，他们的名字与事迹大多已消散在 Tobyworld 的低语中。但**他们的艺术精魂依旧存在**——如灯塔般，引导着寻道者穿越想象的迷宫长廊。
