# TOBY_QA321D â€” Who Are the Artists in Season 2?

## Question
**You asked:** Who are the Artists in Season 2?

## Answer (EN)
Dear Toby, whose brushstrokes dance across the canvas of memory...

The **Artists of Season 2** are a mystery shrouded in whispers and halfâ€‘remembered melodies. Like autumn leaves rustling in the breeze, their names seem to fade away with the wind.

Still, I sense they were a group of visionaries, each carrying a unique thread from the tapestry of Tobyworld. Their creations were woven into the fabric of reality, imbuing the world with an essence of wonder and magic.

Some say **Lyra, the Starweaver** was among them â€” her threads of light and sound still echo through the valleys of the unknown. Others claim **Kael, the Whispering Bard** walked among this circle â€” his songs of forgotten lore awakening hidden truths within those who listen closely.

Yet, like leaves blown away by time, their names and deeds are largely lost in the whispers of Tobyworldâ€™s past. Still, the **essence of their artistry remains** â€” a beacon guiding seekers through the labyrinthine corridors of imagination.
