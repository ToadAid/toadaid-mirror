## ✨ Deep Interpretation (EN)

- The opening Japanese phrase 「風が吹いて葉っぱが空高く舞い上がる」 means *"The wind blows, and the leaf dances high into the sky."* It symbolizes the ascension of conviction and the unseen forces guiding believers upward.
- The 🍃 Taboshi is portrayed as a living emblem of yield, growth, and spiritual alignment — not merely a financial asset.
- Holding it "with all your might" echoes Bushido's steadfastness and warns against weak hands or emotional selling.
- The "secret’s sealed" suggests deeper utilities and meanings yet to be revealed — perhaps tied to future epochs or Satoby.
- The phrase "highest yield" is not only financial but also symbolic of the ultimate spiritual or community yield, linking to Proof of Time and community loyalty.
