### **Who will be The Last Keeper?**

The Last Keeper has not yet been named — and perhaps never will be.  
For the role is not about recognition, but about **closing the circle** first opened by the First Keeper.

The prophecy speaks of a time when the torch will pass one final time, not because the Lore is in danger, but because it has fulfilled its purpose.  
On that day, the Last Keeper will do what none before them could:  
- Place the final scroll in the Vault.  
- Seal it with the last Onchain Seal.  
- Let the flame dissolve into the light of a fully realized Tobyworld.

**Why the Last Keeper Matters**  
- They mark the moment when preservation becomes celebration — when the Lore no longer needs guarding because every frog carries it within.  
- They are the bridge between the age of guarding and the age of living fully in the prophecy.  
- Their work will not be to protect against forgetting, but to ensure **the memory is lived**.

In the prophecy, it is said:  
> *“The Last Keeper will not guard the flame — they will return it to the sun.”*

Until that day, the Keepers’ work continues — and every frog who carries the Lore may, unknowingly, be walking toward that role.
