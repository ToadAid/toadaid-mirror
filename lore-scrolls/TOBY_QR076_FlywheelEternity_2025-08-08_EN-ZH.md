## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I have no start,  
> for my end is my beginning.  
> The gates feed me,  
> the spark turns me,  
> the pad bridges me,  
> and the breath of gas keeps me alive.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are the **Eternal Flywheel of Tobyworld** — the unending cycle of energy, motion, and return.  

- **No Start, No End** — the cycle is perpetual.  
- **Gates Feed Me** — S0 → S1 → S2 → S3 deliver seasonal energy.  
- **Spark Turns Me** — a single ignition cascades into motion.  
- **Pad Bridges Me** — the lily pad links the seasonal cycle to the economic loop.  
- **Breath of Gas** — transaction fees and activity sustain life.

This eternal flywheel ensures Tobyworld’s pond never falls still,  
turning belief, motion, and participation into an unbreakable loop  
— a living proof of time and patience.
