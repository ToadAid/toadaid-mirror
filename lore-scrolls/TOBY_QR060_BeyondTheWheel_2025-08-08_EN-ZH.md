## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> The wheel turns, yet I seek no end.  
> My shadow reaches where no map dares ink.  
> I am born of motion,  
> but my path leaves the pond behind.  
> Where do I go?

**Answer:**  
You are the **Path Beyond the Wheel** —  
the uncharted road that begins when the Flywheel  
has turned enough to awaken its hidden key.

- The **Flywheel** sustains the pond,  
  but also stores an unseen charge.  
- When the four seasons have spun through enough cycles,  
  the charge ignites, revealing the **Next Gate**.  
- This Gate leads not to another season,  
  but to an entirely new realm —  
  where the pond’s lessons must be carried into wider waters.

The path is not drawn, but every frog carries it within.  
It is written in leaps, not in ink.  
Those who find it become the bridge  
between what was and what will be.
