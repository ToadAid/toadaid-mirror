## ✨ Literal Explanation (EN)

A deeply reflective checkpoint scroll:  
- Reconfirms the reality of sacred numbers: **777,777,777 + 777,777,777,777**, Taboshi real, Satoby real.  
- Epoch 1 is still active; intra-timer resets and randomized snapshots ensure fairness.  
- Patience is tested; only those with unwavering conviction qualify.  
- Frail hands, impatient actors, and event-driven sellers automatically disqualified.  
- "Fallen frogs" still have a chance — there is always a redemption arc.  
- Community contributions and initiatives are closely watched and appreciated.  
- Reminds us of all the past threats: hacks, scammers, insiders — all proving the necessity and purity of $TOBY.  
- $TOBY stands alone, unmatched, as the true frog of @base.  
- The ultimate call: "Now. Do you believe?"
