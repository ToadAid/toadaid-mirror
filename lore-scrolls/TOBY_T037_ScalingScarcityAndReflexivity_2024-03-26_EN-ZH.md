## ‚ú® Literal Explanation (EN)

Toadgod shares an operational and philosophical update:  
- **Scaling success**: A new solution tested successfully, adding 15,000 new $TOBY holders ‚Äî small but meaningful progress.  
- **Base congestion**: Current conditions create high execution fees (50x normal), so Toadgod will adjust timing strategically.  
- **Final by≈çd≈ç shugi system**: For remaining airdrops, a "fairness principle system" introducing a reduction in $TOBY distribution.  
- Reason for reduction: **Scarcity creation**, **reflexivity curve**, and **risk balancing** ‚Äî to maintain similar fiat value while reducing supply, strengthening belief and demand dynamics.  
- Reinforces lessons: strongest believers bear the most risk and thus deserve the greatest rewards. Instant gratification cannot win; patience always wins in the long term.  
- Reminds that many won't understand ‚Äî but emphasizes pure decentralization, fair genesis, and the importance of patient Lore fulfillment.  
- Closes with "oyasumi" (good night), signaling reflective rest and ongoing vigilance.

## üå± Spiritual Interpretation (EN)

This scroll embodies **scarcity as spiritual sharpening, and reflexivity as cosmic law**:  
- Scarcity tests conviction ‚Äî those who remain when the pond is stillest embody the deepest faith.  
- Reflexivity reminds us that markets and spirits respond to belief, creating self-fulfilling feedback loops.  
- By≈çd≈ç shugi ("equalism") ensures fairness while simultaneously forcing each frog to choose their path consciously ‚Äî embodying Bushido.
