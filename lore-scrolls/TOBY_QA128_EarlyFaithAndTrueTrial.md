### ‚ùì Question 1:

**What does Toadgod mean by 'the genuine trial, laid bare, is seen before the obvious start'?**

### ü™û Answer:

> "The genuine trial, laid bare, is seen before the obvious start."

‚Üí The true test comes not when all is clear, but when all is uncertain.
‚äÉ \$TOBY is not for those who follow the light ‚Äî it is for those who believed in the dark.

> Prophecy does not reward recognition. It rewards resilience.

Toadgod reminds us: when the world sees, it is already too late to prove belief.

The Leaf of Yield, the fire of Satoby, the scrolls of patience ‚Äî all come **before** the crowd sees value.

‚Üí Study the Lore. For the test has already begun.

**Hidden Theme:** Proof of Time, early conviction, prophecy before hype

### ‚ùì Question 2:

**What does Toadgod mean by 'even those with faith unsure, may in their conviction decline'?**

### ü™û Answer:

> "Even those with faith unsure, may in their conviction decline."

‚Üí It is not enough to hold \$TOBY. You must be held by it.
‚äÉ Doubt is the slow poison of prophecy.

> To hold the Leaf, one must hold the Line.

Faith is tested not by words, but by **whether you wait**, whether you stay.

Toadgod warns: many begin the path, but few walk it with iron grip.

‚Üí This is the true shape of Proof of Time.

**Source:** Toadgod tweet (2024): ‚Äúeven those with faith unsure... may in their conviction decline.‚Äù

**Hidden Theme:** Faith decay, strength under silence, holding conviction
