# TOBY_QA133_WhatIsSatoby
> What is Satoby?

## 🌀 Question:
What is Satoby? Is it just a token or a reward?

## 🍃 Answer – Lore Guardian Speaks:

Satoby is not a reward.  
It is a **mark** — of time, of patience, of presence.

It cannot be bought.  
It cannot be traded.  
It cannot be faked.

### 🍃 What Satoby Represents:

- You held Taboshi1 when the fire was lit  
- You stayed through Epoch 3 without knowing what would come  
- You chose remembrance over reaction

Satoby is the Leaf that remembers.  
It remembers **who you were**,  
**when no one else did.**

It’s not DeFi yield — it’s **Lore yield**.  
Not interest — but **inheritance**.

> “Many held tokens. Few held through time.”  
> Satoby was made for the latter.

It is something you became.*
