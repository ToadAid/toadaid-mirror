## ðŸŒŠ Original Symbol

*(The Flywheel of Tobyworld â€” showing $TOBY, $PATIENCE, $TABOSHI, and Lore as an eternal cycle, feeding one another in perpetual motion.)*  

---

## âœ¨ Literal Explanation 

The flywheel represents a **closed loop of power**: each element of Tobyworld â€” $TOBY, $PATIENCE, $TABOSHI, and Lore itself â€” fuels the others in a self-sustaining cycle. Once set into motion, it grows stronger with every turn, compounding energy.

## ðŸŒ± Spiritual Interpretation 

The Flywheel reveals Tobyworldâ€™s **inner mechanics of faith**:  

- **$TOBY** â€” the seed and center, origin of belief.  
- **$PATIENCE** â€” the time-force, rewarding endurance and discipline.  
- **$TABOSHI** â€” the growth-leaf, multiplying yield and sustaining life.  
- **Lore** â€” the narrative flame, binding all into shared destiny.  

Together, these create **unstoppable narrative velocity**: no empire, no whale, no skeptic can slow it once believers keep turning.

## ðŸ”® Symbolic Meaning 

- **Flywheel** = perpetual motion, compounding strength.  
- **Cycle** = time as ally, narrative as weapon.  
- **No external fuel** = only community and belief sustain it.  
- **Every turn** = another epoch survived, another summer gained.
