## ðŸŒŠ Original Tweet (EN)

> prev 2 weeks. meditation and observation. many weak > strong hands, many folded, some doubled down. transfers happened regardless: wealth & conviction. predictively most not possess patience or stomach for $toby let alone read this entire tweet.  
> 
> war. ego. fud. macro. govts. fiat. banks. inflation. manipulation. interest rates. institutions. manipulation  imitators, naysayers, rigged distribution, everything the lore spoke of.  
> 
> patterns not repeat yet rhyme. ones who studied lore see clear accuracy (if not, read previous tweets for proof). generational wealth transfer will continue to happen. $toby pristine fundamentals from inception. many overlook. part of game / free market, not all will make it.  
> 
> just a meme ? more?  speculation ? remember whole asset class is speculative, including top 10 and satoshis creation. nakamoto designed and let community create meaning. does profitability ratios = true stock price? no.  
> 
> value accrues from where? technology, distribution, adoption, utility. most importantly: community http://t.me/toadgang and speculation itself. this gives value. same for all projects and tokens. understand this well. the speculative buffer creates equality and opportunity. and $toby is for the people.  
> 
> every epoch will be fulfilled by toad god. differences? equality. fair distribution, no pre sale. kols. insiders. vcs. was it all an option? yes.  
> 
> toad god refuses to kiss the ring. for only rich get richer and enslavement will continue to exist. $toby does not plan to fit societal industry norms or part of the vc machine. it never has. never will.  
> 
> one can have best itamae but if nobody can taste or eat the most glorious fish or sushi. what good is this? hence $toby world inception.  
> 
> all events unfolded in last weeks. written in the lore already. newcomers seeking enlightenment? study past messages. it may be the most important thing you do.  
> 
> those whom are mere passengers will likely be shaken out. apologies. its not personal. for those who chase short term highs ultimately suffer the consequences. earned not given.  
> 
> $toby cute frog of @base. nothing has changed. born for the people. closing the gap. for the fallen frogs yet many will be mocked and called delusional. many emotional, many impatient. many tested, many will fail. congratulations those weathering the storm. you will enjoy the fruits eventually. the always continued laughter and sneers are just part of journey. plans already made.  
> 
> of course toad god positioned. designed with everything in mind. wisdom. chaos. human greed. foundation, exchange, chain, wallet. user base, numbers. onboarding.  
> 
> simulate and calculate everything oneself. its easy to see why it will always be in our favour to win for it was destined. $toby more than most think as they never calculate.  
> 
> designed mechanics system, for those supported $toby since inception rewarded most. multitude of ways for every epoch. is $toby just ordinary meme?  cute frog of @base that yields more â€¦ upholding @base onchain summer and based ethos. after first epoch, those actively involved in distribution phase will benefit most of 3. unlike any other. toad god pays attention to all. community initiatives, mods, guardians, voices. epoch 1 will be critical, distribution is extremely important.  
> 
> remember the btc faucet? now fast forward till todays evolution. fair airdrops were designed to be one part of epoch 1,  philosophy bleeds through,  $toby embodies. till the end.  
> 
> reality, most chase when too late, most overlook. never digest true lore philosophy.  toad god sacrifices to make fair for as many people.  
> 
> many will revisit lore. see that once upon a time toad sama bellowed from rooftops. attention economy will be the curse. but the war is within. those who managed win war will yield the most. taboshi. satoby. all real. most wonâ€™t read this far. in the end. ishi no Ue ni mo San-nen

## âœ¨ Literal Explanation (EN)

A profound scroll summarizing cycles, patience, speculation, distribution philosophy, and ultimate rewards:  
- Meditation on recent weeks: weak hands folding, strong doubling down â€” a constant wealth transfer.  
- Macro illusions: governments, inflation, banks, naysayers â€” all foretold in lore.  
- Speculation is the foundation of all assets â€” even Bitcoin and traditional stocks.  
- Value is born not from ratios, but from meaning: community, adoption, narrative.  
- $TOBY refuses to join the VC-insider game â€” chosen to remain pure, bushido.  
- Epoch 1 is critical: fair airdrops echo early Bitcoin faucet era.  
- Most won't understand in time; only patient warriors will reap Taboshi & Satoby.  
- A final test: can one endure the inner war?

## ðŸŒ± Spiritual Interpretation (EN)

This scroll embodies **the eternal inner war and the law of cosmic merit**:  
- Many fall, not because of market, but their own minds.  
- The truest test is emotional mastery â€” conquering fear, greed, impatience.  
- The rewards (Taboshi, Satoby) are spiritual reflections of this victory.

## ðŸ”® Symbolic Meaning (EN)

- **Cycles and patterns**: Not repeated exactly, but rhymed.  
- **Epochs**: Purification stages for true believers.
