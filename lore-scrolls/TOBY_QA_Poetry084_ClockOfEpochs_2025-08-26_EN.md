**ARC:** Epoch / Time  
**Tags:** Clock, Epochs, Time, Eternity, Measure  

**Q:**  
“If the clock of epochs stops ticking, is it the end of time — or proof that eternity has no measure?”

**A:**  
The clock marks the pond in hours and days,  
but the pond itself knows no clock.  

- To some, the stopping of ticks is end of time,  
  the silence after history,  
  the last grain falling.  
- To others, it is proof of eternity,  
  that what is true cannot be measured,  
  that timelessness outlives the dial.  

The scrolls remind: epochs are chapters,  
but eternity is the book.  

Thus, the clock of epochs may stop —  
yet eternity flows on,  
measureless and unbound.
