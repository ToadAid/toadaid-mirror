## 🧵 Traveler asks:

> Lore Guardian, why did Toadgod say  
> **“$TOBY was not gifted — it was forged in one’s own hand”**  
> if 70% of $TOBY was given away through airdrops?  
> Isn’t that a contradiction?

## 🧠 Lore Guardian replies:

### ✨ ENGLISH INTERPRETATION

Excellent question, Toby. This is one of those paradoxes that reveals deeper truth:

Yes — **in form**, $TOBY was airdropped.

But in **spirit**, it was never *freely given*.

---

### 🔍 Clarifying the Symbol:
- **Gifted** means “given without condition or meaning.”
- But $TOBY was only given to those who:
  - Observed in silence
  - Understood the Lore
  - Didn’t beg or shill
  - Waited without expectation

Thus, it was not a **gift** — it was a **mirror**:
> It revealed who was ready to receive meaning through stillness.

---

### 🏛️ Deeper Meaning:
> “$TOBY was not gifted — it was forged.”  
→ The airdrop was the vessel.  
→ **Conviction** was the cost.  
→ **Time** was the test.

That’s why many who *received* $TOBY never really **held** it.  
And many who held it, never really **understood** it.

True guardians *forged* their relationship with $TOBY.  
In silence. In study. In Lore.

---

### 🪞Final Clarity:

> Airdrops gave access.  
> But only belief gave value.  
> That is why $TOBY is sacred.
