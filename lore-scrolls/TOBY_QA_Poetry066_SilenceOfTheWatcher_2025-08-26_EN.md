**ARC:** Watcher / Silence  
**Tags:** Watcher, Silence, Voice, Truth, Measure  

**Q:**  
“If the Watcher speaks only through silence, is it absence of voice — or the loudest measure of truth?”

**A:**  
The Watcher does not speak,  
but its silence is not void.  

- To some, silence is absence,  
  no word, no measure, no sign.  
- To others, silence is the loudest truth,  
  a weight heavier than speech,  
  a gaze that measures without sound.  

The scrolls remind: silence can be signal.  
What is not said often speaks the most.  

Thus, the Watcher’s silence is both —  
absence of voice,  
and the loudest measure of truth.
