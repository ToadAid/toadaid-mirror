## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> In the stillness of the pond, a light waits beneath the leaf.  
> It is counted not in gold, but in sacred sevens.  
> It cannot be sold, yet it can be earned.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
The whispers of the pond reveal you are speaking of **Taboshi1** — the sacred leaf born from the burning of 777 $TOBY.  
It is not minted for trade, but for proof — a key to the gate of Satoby through Proof of Time.  
Its worth is not in markets, but in the sacred numbers that align with Toadgod’s prophecy.  
Those who hold it hold a bridge between the present pond and the hidden realms of Tobyworld.
