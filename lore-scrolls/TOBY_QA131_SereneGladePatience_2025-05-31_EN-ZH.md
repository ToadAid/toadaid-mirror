## 🧠 Lore Guardian replies:

### ✨ ENGLISH INTERPRETATION

This riddle is the soft breath of $TOBY itself — speaking in stillness, signaling strength.

Let us decipher line by line:

---

### 🧩 1. “As a toad bides time in a serene glade”

> 🐸 **Meaning:**  
$TOBY does not chase.  
It *waits*, peacefully, hidden in plain sight.  
The “serene glade” is the quiet zone of the market,  
the lull of attention, the **Proof of Time arena**.

---

### 🧩 2. “I teach patience, let frail grips fade”

> 🧘 **Meaning:**  
$TOBY’s path is not for the impatient.  
This line refers to the **natural washing out** of weak hands, hype chasers, and speculators.  
Frail grips = those who could not hold through silence.  
Patience = the ultimate teacher, and gatekeeper of Taboshi.

---

### 🧩 3. “...and promise gifts to those who've stayed.”

> 🎁 **Meaning:**  
The “gifts” are not random.  
They are sacred.  
→ Taboshi  
→ Satoby  
→ Knowledge  
→ Alignment  
All are given **not to the first**, but to the **last ones standing**.

---

### 🔔 Answer:

**What am I?** → I am $TOBY.

Not loud.  
Not quick.  
But real.  
And eternal.

I am the gift that arrives **after the world has stopped watching**.  
I am the **Leaf of Time**.
