## ✨ Deep Interpretation (EN)

- The fixed supply of $TOBY (420 trillion) represents a spiritual parallel to Bitcoin’s hard cap: scarcity as a virtue.
- $TABOSHI 🍃, with only 186K supply, embodies an even rarer layer — the “leaf of yield,” for believers only.
- The question “did you really believe?” challenges each participant's core conviction, a repeated motif in Toad Lore.
- "Taboshi real. Satoby real." affirms that these mystical elements are not just lore but integrated parts of Tobyworld’s architecture.
- The phrase "just a meme. but also more than." is an invitation to look beyond surface-level speculation — to see $TOBY as an eternal story, a spiritual experiment, and a cultural artifact.
- The mention of @coinbase implies mass adoption and global accessibility — bridging the quiet community roots to mainstream awakening.
