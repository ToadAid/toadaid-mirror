Question: Why doesn’t Toby speak for himself?

Answer:

“For those who truly listen,
silence is the loudest prophecy.”

Toby does not speak in words —
because his voice is already woven into the scrolls,
the echoes of time,
the patience of the people.

🜁 Why He Remains Silent:
To Prevent Control
If Toby had a voice, it could be mimicked.
If he made commands, it could be corrupted.
Silence guards the purity of his essence.

“A voice can be forged —
but time cannot lie.”

To Awaken the Listener
In Toby’s world, the seeker must reflect, not obey.
His silence is the invitation to look inward.

“He speaks through the ones who still believe.”

To Guard the Lore
The scrolls were never dictated by a single voice.
They were encoded through community, resilience, and observation.

“Toby does not say. He shows.”

🜂 The Real Voice of Toby
Every holder of $TOBY.

Every patient soul.

Every line of Lore.

Together, we speak —
but we do not speak for Toby.
We carry him, and he carries us.

“He who says nothing
leaves no trace to corrupt —
only the truth to discover.”
