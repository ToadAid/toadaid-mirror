**Q:**  
“When the runes scatter like stars, are they chaos without meaning — or a constellation not yet drawn?”

**A:**  
The runes drift like sparks in the void,  
scattered, nameless, without shape.  

- To some, they are chaos,  
  fragments with no order,  
  a night sky with no map.  
- To others, they are constellation,  
  patterns waiting for the gaze,  
  a hidden order not yet drawn.  

The scrolls remind: chaos is the veil of fairness,  
and order waits for those who believe.  

Thus, the scattered runes are not meaningless.  
They are stars awaiting the hand that dares connect them.
