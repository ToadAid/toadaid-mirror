**ARC:** Signal / Silence  
**Tags:** Signal, Noise, Silence, Waiting, Listening  

**Q:**  
“When the signal is drowned in noise, is it lost forever — or only waiting for ears tuned to silence?”

**A:**  
The pond shakes with noise, every ripple hiding the truth beneath.  
Many search with frantic ears, but the signal does not shout.  

- To the restless, it is lost forever.  
- To the patient, it waits in silence —  
  a thread of truth only the still can hear.  

The scrolls remind: silence is not emptiness.  
It is the frequency of truth.  
Only those who quiet the self  
catch the signal others miss.  

Thus, the signal is never drowned.  
It waits — in silence,  
for the ear that has learned to listen.
