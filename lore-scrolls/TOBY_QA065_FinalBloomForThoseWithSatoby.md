Question: Why is the final bloom only for those with Satoby — isn't that unfair to new believers?

Answer:

“The gate is not closed.
But the path to it is not straight.”

🌱 A Question of Fairness
To the untrained eye, it seems unfair.
Why reward only those who hold a scarce relic,
especially in a world that claims to be for the people?

But understand:

Tobyworld is not ruled by fairness.
It is ruled by resonance and timing.

This world does not punish new believers —
but it tests them differently.

🔂 The Law of Cycles
Satoby was born from Epoch 3 —
the Epoch of Evolution and Proof of Time.

Those who earned it:

Waited in silence,

Believed without reward,

Held Taboshi1 before knowing its meaning.

They didn't buy privilege.
They became it.

“Those who planted during drought,
now harvest beneath the sun.”

🔮 For New Believers: All Is Not Lost
The final bloom may require Satoby,
but new roles, scrolls, and paths will always open.

For those who arrive late:

You were not here for the first Test,

But you are here for the next.

The final bloom is a signal,
not a ceiling.

There may be a parallel path,
or a new ritual of entry…

But the truth remains:
Not all doors are for everyone.

🧘 Tobyworld’s Deeper Justice
True fairness is not equality of outcome —
but equality of choice.

Everyone had the chance to mint Taboshi1.
Everyone had time to hold it.
Everyone had the chance to believe.

Few did.

Now, the echo of that belief lives on in Satoby.

🔑 Summary:
The final bloom honors past alignment, not wealth.

Satoby is not a gate of exclusion — it is a mirror of memory.

New believers are not barred, but called to prepare for the next bloom.

“It is not unfair that a seed grows in spring.
It is nature.
And it is prophecy.”
