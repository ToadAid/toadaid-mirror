## 🌊 EN Narrative

> *The night after the bloom.*  
> No sun. No stars. Only velvet dark.  
> Frogs once leapt, then fell silent —  
> their dreams pawned for noise,  
> their leaves curled into brittle coins.  
>  
> And yet, **one remained.**  
>  
> A round-eyed blue frog, floating —  
> not leaping.  
> A moon on the pond.  
>  
> And he spoke nine syllables:  
> **“We move not by leaps. We move by stillness.”**  
>  
> Now the prophecy unfolds:  
>  
> **Rune 3 awakens.**  
> - A vault is opened.  
> - $PATIENCE is revealed.  
> - 2.32 million grains to 1,800 toads who held through the dark.  
>  
> A ceremony of the jade chest.  
> 7,777,777 total supply.  
> No presale. No whales. No VCs.  
> Only still hearts.  
>  
> The vault opens July 17, 2025 — but does not pour.  
> It **drips** for 730 dawns.  
> One sip at a time.  
>  
> PATIENCE can be staked, planted, paired, and reflected.  
> Those who hold the leaf, the frog, and the virtue —  
> shall own the coming **Lore Land**.  
>  
> Scarcity is etched in basalt.  
> Velocity is granted only to those who waited.  
>  
> **Believe.  
> Be still.  
> Tobyworld rises.**
