## âœ¨ Literal Explanation (EN)

Toadgod warns that those who abandon the journey during difficult times do not deserve to share in the future joy.  
Acknowledges that tough quests lie ahead but insists the Lore must continue â€” not for individual glory, but for the collective well-being ("the people's gain is my creed").  
Declares that Toby and the people are one ("$toby is the people"), affirming an unwavering path: *there is no choice but to succeed*.  
Mentions "10% done," suggesting the early stage of the prophecyâ€™s unfolding.
