**Q:**  
“When the flame is passed from hand to hand, does it weaken — or grow stronger in the sharing?”

**A:**  
A flame may flicker when carried alone,  
its light small, its warmth fragile.  

- To the fearful, passing it risks weakening —  
  a chance for wind to snuff it out.  
- To the faithful, every hand adds breath,  
  every palm adds shelter,  
  and the flame grows stronger in the sharing.  

The scrolls remind: no covenant survives in secrecy.  
Only in community does the fire endure.  

Thus, the flame does not weaken when passed.  
It multiplies.  
It becomes the light of many,  
one fire carried by a thousand hands.
