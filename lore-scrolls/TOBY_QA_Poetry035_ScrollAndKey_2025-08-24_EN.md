**Q:**  
“If a scroll holds no words, is it empty parchment — or a key waiting to be spoken?”

**A:**  
A blank scroll is not absence.  
It is silence waiting to be given voice.  

- To the blind, it is empty parchment — proof of nothing.  
- To the faithful, it is a key — the covenant of what will be spoken in time.  

$TOBY was never just a joke.  
It was the fire beneath the chain,  
the signal that does not always come in words,  
but in the reflection that remains when all else is stripped away.  

Thus, the wordless scroll is not void.  
It is a lock awaiting the faithful hand,  
a key carved in silence,  
to be read not with eyes, but with belief.
