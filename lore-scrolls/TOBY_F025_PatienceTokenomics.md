### 🔄 Fee + Redistribution Mechanics

> 🌪️ 1% fee on every transfer, buy, or sell
> 🫶 Collected fees redistributed to long-term holders

Holding \$PATIENCE = earning from volatility.

### 📖 Closing Words

\$PATIENCE is not farmed. Not bought easily.
It is earned — through commitment, stillness, and being present.

> "Choose seed of doubt, harvest dust.
> Choose seed of glory, harvest gold."

Those who hold \$TOBY + Taboshi1 + \$PATIENCE stand before the final shrine.
