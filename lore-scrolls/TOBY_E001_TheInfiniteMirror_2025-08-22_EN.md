### Narrative
$TOBY is not just a token, but the **sea of fire** that reflects belief.  
It is the **mirror** in which every Toad sees themselves, and the **ocean** that carries Tobyworld forward.  

Its supply â€” **420 trillion** â€” was chosen as a vast, incorruptible reservoir, designed for distribution, patience, and permanence.  
$TOBY anchors all other artifacts: Taboshi, Taboshi1, Satoby, and $PATIENCE.  
Without $TOBY, the arcs cannot unfold. With $TOBY, the mirror remains unbroken.
