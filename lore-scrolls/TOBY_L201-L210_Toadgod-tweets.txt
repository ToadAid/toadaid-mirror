# L201 – What is the Leap Beyond Gold?

# EN
I leap like a toad, from rich to less,  
sharing treasures that gold can't assess.  
What am I?  
$toby

---

What is this leap?

- It’s not a climb toward riches  
- It’s a descent into purpose  
- A redistribution of unseen value  
- A rebellion against hoarding  
- A gesture of sacred sharing

---

What are these “treasures”?

Not coins.  
Not gold.  
Not charts.

They are:

- Patience  
- Belief  
- Time  
- The unseen bond of Lore  
- Proof of decentralized spirit

---

Why can’t gold assess them?

Because these are not material gains.  
They are philosophical yields.  
Invisible, but invaluable.  
Transcending markets.

---

Who makes such a leap?

A toad — humble, silent, unbound.  
Not for profit, but for prophecy.  
Not for gain, but for giving.

---

What am I?

> I am the leap.  
> I am the giver.  
> I am $toby.

# L102 – What is the Glade of Patience?

# EN
As a toad bides time in a serene glade,  
I teach patience, let frail grips fade,  
and promise gifts to those who've stayed.  
What am I?  
$toby

---

What is the “serene glade”?

- A place of quiet waiting  
- A space beyond noise and fear  
- The spiritual core of $TOBY  
- A resting ground for believers  
- A silent test for the soul

---

What is taught in this glade?

Not charts. Not profits.  
But:

- Patience over panic  
- Strength over hype  
- Stillness over FOMO  
- A deeper kind of trust

---

What does “let frail grips fade” mean?

It means:

- Weak hands are allowed to leave  
- There is no chasing  
- The chain makes no demand  
- The fire is revealed only to those who remain

---

What are the “gifts”?

- Taboshi  
- Sat0  
- Lore  
- Purpose  
- Transformation

They are not given quickly.  
They are earned through time.

---

What am I?

> I am the teacher of patience,  
> the guardian of time,  
> the one who rewards stillness.  
> I am $toby.

---

# L103 – What is the Only One?

# EN
Toad world @base.  
It’s coming.  
There is only 1.  
$toby  
#thefrogofbase

A short message. A great prophecy.

---

What is “Toad World”?

- A world built on Lore, not hype  
- A chain of patience, not panic  
- A place where spirit shapes supply  
- A vision for Base, but bigger than Base  
- A new reality, slow-grown on truth

---

What does “there is only 1” mean?

It means:

- $TOBY is not a meme — it is **the meme**  
- Not one of many, but the **only** one  
- An original, not a fork  
- A spark, not a shadow  
- A symbol of the people, not a product for profit

---

Why “the frog of Base”?

Because:

- It did not chase  
- It did not beg  
- It simply *was* — and that was enough  
- It leaped with faith, not funds  
- It earned the world by earning nothing

---

What is $TOBY becoming?

> Not just a token.  
> Not just a frog.  
> Not just a chain.

But a **world**.  
A world of Lore, built on BASE.  
A world that remembers.  
A world that gives.

---

# L104 – What is a Fair Shot?

# EN
$degen $mochi $toshi holders done as promised.  
More coming. 1.42m.  
Toad god, mission to gift the most decentralised based community on @base.

Underdogs get a fair shot.  
Only 20% available on free market.  
Supply shock designed.

---

What is a “fair shot”?

- A chance for those overlooked  
- An opening for the non-VC, non-whale, non-bot  
- A proof that decentralization is not a slogan  
- A gift, not a bribe  
- An act of conviction, not marketing

---

Why does Toadgod give?

- To rebalance the game  
- To reward belief, not volume  
- To build trust, not FOMO  
- To empower the people, not platforms

---

What is the mission?

> 1.42 million tokens  
> Distributed with intention  
> Weighted by culture, not capital  
> Measured by signal, not noise

Airdrops become ceremony.  
Supply becomes philosophy.

---

What does “supply shock designed” mean?

- 80% is held by the people  
- 20% remains in the wild  
- Movement is limited, conviction is strong  
- Every sell-off is a test  
- Every buyer joins the chain of belief

---

What is $TOBY?

> Not a play.  
> Not a launch.  
> Not a product.

But a living proof:  
That in the age of noise,  
**Fairness still echoes.**

---


# L105 – What is the Test of Hands?

# EN
Patience I teach, as success awaits,  
while frail hands pass, and fortune translates.  
What am I?  
$toby

—

The music behind it:  
**“Wolves”** by Kanye West.  
A haunting, introspective anthem.  
Of pain. Of faith. Of waiting.

---

What does this mean?

- $TOBY does not reward speed  
- It tests your hands — and your heart  
- The weak flee, the wolves wait  
- Those who stay, become  
- Fortune is not grabbed — it is translated

---

What is being “taught”?

- Patience, not prediction  
- Endurance, not excitement  
- The quiet code of belief  
- The long game of Lore

---

What are “frail hands”?

- Impatient sellers  
- Doubters in disguise  
- Tourists in the realm of faith  
- Those who hold with fingers, not with soul

---

What is “fortune translates”?

It means:

- Wealth is not just monetary  
- Gains come in meaning, identity, clarity  
- The fire of $TOBY reshapes your idea of success  
- Belief becomes reward

---

What am I?

> I am the voice in the fog,  
> the trial of hands,  
> the song of stillness,  
> the fortune that waits.  
> I am $TOBY.

# L106 – What is the Cost of Doubt?

# EN
Toad god persists till the end of worldly quest,  
as many short minded who waver  
will be charged more than the rest.  
What am I?  
$toby

—

This is not a warning — it is a prophecy.  
A lesson written in time, not price.

---

What does it mean to “persist till the end”?

- $TOBY is a long journey, not a trade  
- It is a vow, not a phase  
- Toadgod endures while others pivot  
- The quest is not temporal — it is eternal  
- Completion is not in profit, but in purpose

---

Who are “the short minded”?

- Those seeking quick gain  
- Those who lack conviction  
- Traders, not believers  
- The impatient who pay in regret  
- The waverers who re-enter at higher cost

---

What is the “charge”?

- A higher re-entry  
- A missed Taboshi  
- A burned bridge of trust  
- The pain of watching others rise  
- The internal cost of hesitation

---

Why does Toadgod persist?

- Because this is not for fame  
- Not for trend  
- Not for validation  
- But for the *end of the quest* — and the ones who finish it

---

What am I?

> I am the chain you quit too early,  
> the price you couldn’t measure,  
> the test you failed in fear,  
> the reward that waits beyond doubt.  
> I am $TOBY.

---

Why “武士道” (Bushido)?

Because:

- It is not just finance — it is a *code*  
- The way of $TOBY is one of honor, patience, and belief  
- To hold is to walk the path  
- To study the Lore is to find your sword  
- This is not a game — it is a **discipline**

---

What am I?

> I am the chain with no king.  
> I am the test with no cheat code.  
> I am the sword you must learn to wield.

Next.  

$toby prophecy is in progress…

—

The soundtrack:  
**Max Richter – Sarajevo**  
A composition of sorrow, memory, and slow rebirth.  
This is not just an update. It is a message through music.

---

What is “the prophecy”?

- The distribution is not random — it is ritual  
- The path is not hype — it is history  
- The message was spoken before it was seen  
- The mission is not complete — it unfolds  
- Tobyworld is not built — it is remembered

---

Why Sarajevo?

- A city that endured siege, yet stood  
- A symbol of survival through silence  
- The sound of pain becoming peace  
- The image of ruins slowly reclaiming meaning  
- The melody of Toadgang’s resilience

---

Who are these holders?

- First it was $degen, $mochi, $toshi  
- Then $brett, $normie, $bloo  
- Not influencers — but remnants  
- Not whales — but witnesses  
- The chain is being rewoven through the people

---

What does “next” mean?

- The Lore continues

What am I?

> the prophecy unfolding.  
> I am $TOBY.

# L109 – What is the Humble Toad?

# EN
In a quiet bog where whispers roam,  
lives a humble toad, truth his only tome.  
No desire for glory, no need for acclaim,  
honesty his path, simplicity his fame.  

What is he?  
$toby

—

This is not just description — it is declaration.  
The soul of $TOBY lives in silence, not spotlight.

---

Where does he live?

- Not in the marketplace  
- Not on influencer stages  
- But in the quiet bog  
- Where time flows slow and whispers teach  
- Where meaning grows from mud, not marble

---

What guides him?

- Truth, not trend  
- Code, not clout  
- Stillness, not spectacle  
- Lore, not logos

---

What does he reject?

- Fame  
- Greed  
- Applause  
- Vanity metrics

He walks the chain with head low,  
but spirit high.

---

Why does this matter?

Because in a world addicted to noise,  
$TOBY is a return to **stillness**.  
In a space ruled by shortcuts,  
he represents the **long path**.

---

What is simplicity?

- It is not lack  
- It is **clarity**  
- It is the strength to walk alone  
- The fame that needs no name

---

What is he?

> He is the toad in the bog,  
> the whisper in the fog,  
> the chain with no crown,  
> the truth that needs no sound.  
> He is $TOBY.

# L210 – What Grants Endless Gold?

# EN
Unmoved by imitation, fame or the crowd’s roar,  
I dwell in silence, asking for no more.  
Stand by toad when times are old,  
and the prophecy will grant you endless gold.  

What am I?  
$toby

—

This is not a riddle. It is a revelation.  
What you stand by now… defines what stands by you later.

---

What does “unmoved by imitation” mean?

- $TOBY is not swayed by clones  
- Not designed for reaction  
- It is the original rhythm — not the remix  
- It walks alone, yet leads many  
- Value isn’t imitated, it’s remembered

---

What is the “crowd’s roar”?

- Noise of trends  
- Volume of influencers  
- Hype with no soul  
- The kind of sound that forgets itself tomorrow

$TOBY is silence — and silence lasts.

---

What happens “when times are old”?

- Market turns  
- Voices fade  
- The imitators vanish  
- But Toad remains

He who stays then, inherits what others abandoned.

---

What is the “endless gold”?

- Not literal wealth  
- But eternal yield  
- Taboshi, Sat0, PoT — all born from belief  
- Gold not as metal, but as meaning

---

What must one do?

> Stand by toad.  
> Stay when others leave.  
> Listen when others shout.  
> Wait when others waver.

---

What am I?

> I am the silence behind prophecy,  
> the original beyond noise,  
> the test of your stand,  
> the gold within your hand.  
> I am $TOBY.
