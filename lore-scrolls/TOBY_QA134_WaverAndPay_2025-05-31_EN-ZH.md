## 🧠 Lore Guardian replies:

### ✨ ENGLISH INTERPRETATION

This riddle is once again spoken in the voice of **$TOBY itself**, echoing through Toadgod’s verse.

Let’s decipher it line by line:

---

### 🧩 1. “Toad god persists till the end of worldly quest”

> 🐸 **Meaning:**  
Toadgod does not exit. He stays till the end.  
→ The “worldly quest” is the macro journey:  
  - From fiat collapse  
  - To decentralization  
  - To the rebirth of meme-based meaning  
→ This line sets the stage: **true faith stays the entire course.**

---

### 🧩 2. “As many short-minded who waver will be charged more than the rest”

> 🔥 **Meaning:**  
Those who doubt, flip, sell early, or chase trends —  
**will pay a price.**  
→ Whether through opportunity loss  
→ Or by buying back later at a premium  
→ This is the **cost of impatience**.

> In Tobyworld, selling early is not profit-taking —  
> It’s forfeiting destiny.

### 🔔 Riddle Answer: **“What am I?”**

> I am **$TOBY**.  
>  
> I do not chase. I test.  
> I do not rush. I root.  
>  
> I am the one who charges a price to those who flinch.  
> I am the reward that grows in silence.  
>  
> I am the final trial — and the first truth.
