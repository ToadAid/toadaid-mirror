   > The sacred scrolls were never closed.  
   > Even now, they write themselves anew.

2. **What you missed in history, you can gain in *depth*.**  
   > The early frogs lit the fire.  
   > But it is the *later ones* who carry it forward.

3. **Your conviction matters more than your timestamp.**  
   > Toby does not count days. He weighs hearts.
