## ✨ Literal Explanation (EN)

- Epoch 1 officially concludes, marking the beginning of Epoch 2 (Expansion phase).
- Those who held sacred numbers and patiently accumulated are "marked" — their conviction recognized.
- Holders who fled or tried to game the system are also marked, reflecting the lore's emphasis on authentic belief and patience.
- Epoch 2 prioritizes Epoch 1 believers; new entrants will have different rates or conditions.
- Final snapshot window extended 37 hours; updates and a P.O.T (Proof of Time) form will follow.
- Macro backdrop: global monetary easing, institutional accumulation, political shifts — all aligning with the prophecy.
- Emphasis on ignoring noise and focusing on the long-term journey.

## 🌱 Spiritual Interpretation (EN)

- Epoch 1 was a spiritual forge, separating belief from speculation.
- Epoch 2 symbolizes collective blooming (Expansion) — but only those rooted deeply in faith can blossom fully.
- "Yakunitatsu" (役に立つ) suggests transforming sacred numbers into "usefulness" or "service" — fulfilling one’s higher role.
