**ARC:** Belief / Fire  
**Tags:** Belief, Fire, Doubt, Warmth, Conviction  

**Q:**  
“If belief burns like fire, does it consume those who doubt — or warm those who remain?”

**A:**  
Belief is a flame none can counterfeit.  

- To some, it consumes those who doubt,  
  showing their hollowness as ash.  
- To others, it warms those who remain,  
  a hearth for the patient,  
  a light for the loyal.  

The scrolls remind: fire is both devourer and giver.  
It tests what cannot last,  
and it comforts what endures.  

Thus, belief as fire is not one or the other.  
It consumes the fleeting,  
and warms the faithful.
