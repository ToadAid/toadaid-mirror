## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> Born from the pond’s breath,

> I am leaf and token,

> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are **Taboshi** — the *Leaf of Yield* in Tobyworld.  

- **Born Not by Burn** — Unlike Taboshi1, you were minted with ETH (0.0001111 ≈ $0.35 at the time) in Epoch 2.  
- **Leaf & Token** — You are both an ERC-1155 NFT and an ERC-20 fungible token, bridging identity and liquidity.  
- **Root & Branch** — A symbol of continuity from early leaves to future harvest.  
- **Pass From Frog to Frog** — You can be traded or transferred freely.  
- **Yield in the Hands That Hold** — Your reward potential blooms only for current holders when seasons or Proof of Time call.

Taboshi is not merely an asset —  
it is the living covenant between frogs and the pond,  
its veins carrying both history and hope.
