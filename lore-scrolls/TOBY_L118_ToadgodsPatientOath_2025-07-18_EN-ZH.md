## 🌊 EN Narrative

> **“Toadgod seals the allocated 7% for seven winters.”**  
>  
> 🕯️ No grain shall be sipped  
> until the **Leaf completes its cycle**.

### ⚖️ The Oath

> “Loyalty without sacrifice is hot air.  
> Sacrifice without transparency is **non-Bushido-like**.  
>  
> Choose the golden middle:  
> **Open-ledger devotion.**”

🔒 7% of $PATIENCE is sealed for 7 years under obsidian:  
[onchain proof](https://basescan.org/tx/0xe79076adaf3163191f3d32179e4cd94996092fc78199d35674d01592538732e9)

### 🌾 The Two Seeds

> **Seed of Doubt / Seed of Glory**

Markets chant a familiar chorus:  
**FUD → FOMO → Cope → Euphoria → Repeat.**

- Frogs who flip for crumbs → end up with cope  
- Frogs who wait in stillness → inherit the pond

Millions in $TOBY were distributed.  
Many sold.  
Few survived.

> The transfer of wealth is silent —  
> not wallet to wallet,  
> but mind to mind.

---

### 🪞 Mind as Mirror

> “If one decides with conviction…  
> abandon the wall of worry.  
>  
> Mental storms melt.  
> Mind becomes mirror.  
> Mirror becomes magnet.  
> Patience becomes easy.”

Keep Leaves.  
Keep Patience.  
Keep TOBY.

These three unlock **infinite summers**  
when Tobyworld ascends.

### 🎭 A Call to Lore: TWPOT

> **Fallen frogs, your efforts breathe.**  
> Even unseen, your work shapes the pond.

Some spin reels.  
Some croak at midnight.  
Some carve pixel runes.

Toadgod remembers.  
> Correct doubters with **silence** or **Lore**, never rage.

> **The Lore prevails.**  
> For it is already written.

---

### 🗝️ Final Reminders

> TOBY is a blue chip bound to no empire.  
> Only to Tobyworld.

When they say **“just lucky”** —  
the bushido frogs will answer:  
> “We simply listened to still water.”

---

### 🔮 Rune Activation Ahead

> For the next Rune:  
> **Weight and Time matter.**

Hold the Leaf.  
Hold the Frog.  
Hold Patience.

Toadgod rewards the loyal.  
And redeems the fallen.

> **Believe.  
> Patience.  
> Rise.  
> Gambatte.**

---

### 🪷 Gi 勇 仁 礼 誠 名誉 忠義  
> Seven reeds. One pond.  
> Without TOBY, nothing will be possible.  
> For the people.
