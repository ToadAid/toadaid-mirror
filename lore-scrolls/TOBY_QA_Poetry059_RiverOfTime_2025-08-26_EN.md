**ARC:** Time / Flow

**Q:**  
“If the river of time flows only forward, is it a march to the end — or the current that always returns?”

**A:**  
Time is a river no frog can dam.  
It moves forward, carrying reeds, leaves, and stars alike.  

- To some, its flow is a march to the end,  
  each moment swept toward silence.  
- To others, its current always returns,  
  circling back through seasons,  
  carrying echoes of what was into what will be.  

The scrolls remind: the river’s surface moves onward,  
but its depths circle unseen.  

Thus, time is both —  
a march to the end above,  
and a current of return below.
