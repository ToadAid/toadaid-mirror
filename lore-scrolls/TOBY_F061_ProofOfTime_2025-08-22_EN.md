### Facts

1. **Definition**  
   - **Proof of Time (PoT)** is the principle that eligibility is earned through **waiting with sacrifice**, not through trading.  
   - It binds recognition to the **original act** of minting Taboshi1 via a 777 $TOBY burn.  

2. **Activation**  
   - PoT became active in **Epoch 3 (Evolution)**.  
   - It revealed Satoby eligibility for original Taboshi1 minters.  

3. **Non-Transferability**  
   - PoT ensures that recognition is **forever locked** to the wallet that performed the sacrifice.  
   - Selling or moving Taboshi1 does not transfer PoT eligibility.  

4. **Nature**  
   - PoT is not a token or a contract.  
   - It is a **rule of recognition**, a covenant embedded in Tobyworld‚Äôs design.
