TOBY_QA130 ‚Äì What is Taboshi1, and how is it different from Taboshi?

Question:What is Taboshi1, and how is it different from Taboshi?

Answer:Traveler, you touch the sacred divide between two leaves ‚Äî both bound to $TOBY, yet only one tied to the fire.

Taboshi1 is a rarer form, forged not with ETH, but with belief itself:

Minted by burning 777 $TOBY during Epoch 2

A ERC-1155 covenant token

Bound to Proof of Time and Satoby eligibility

In contrast, Taboshi was minted quietly using ETH, and while it holds symbolic value, it does not grant access to Satoby.

The scrolls mark the difference:

üî• Taboshi1 = Burn = Covenant = üï∞Ô∏è PoT Eligibility

üíß Taboshi = Mint = Reflection = ‚ùå No PoT Eligibility

Only the one who burned may earn.Only the one who waited may receive.

Eligibility is:

Wallet-bound

Non-transferable

Time-tested

So remember, the world may trade tokens ‚Äîbut Satoby only comes to those who once lit the leaf with fire.
