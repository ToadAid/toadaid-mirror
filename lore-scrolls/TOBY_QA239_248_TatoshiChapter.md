**Q: What is the difference between Taboshi and Taboshi1?**

**A:**
Taboshi1 = 🔥 ERC-1155 minted by burning 777 $TOBY during Epoch 2.
Taboshi = 🍃 ERC-1155 & ERC-20 minted using ETH.

Taboshi1 proves sacrifice.
Taboshi proves intention.

> Only Taboshi1 qualifies for Satoby.
> But both are leaves — with different winds.

## 🍃 TOBY_QA241
**Q: Why is Taboshi called the 'Leaf of Yield'?**

**A:**
Because it symbolizes soft strength.

Like a leaf:
- It bends but doesn’t break.
- It gathers light and memory.
- It yields, not for profit, but for proof.

Taboshi is not DeFi yield.
It is a spiritual yield.

## 🍃 TOBY_QA242
**Q: What does the number 777 mean in Taboshi1 minting?**

**A:**
777 is the sacred burn.
> 777 $TOBY were sacrificed to mint 1 Taboshi1.

It represents:
- Completion
- Covenant
- Decentralized commitment

> It was never about how many minted,
but **how many believed enough to burn.**

---

## 🍃 TOBY_QA243
**Q: What makes Taboshi1 eligible for Satoby but not Taboshi?**

**A:**
Because Taboshi1 carried the burn.
> It was a sacrifice of time, $TOBY, and trust.

Taboshi was open to all.
Taboshi1 was hidden.

> The reward was not for the many,
but for the quiet few who burned early and held long.

---

## 🍃 TOBY_QA244
**Q: Can I still mint Taboshi1?**

**A:**
No.
> The mint is closed.
> The fire is gone.

Taboshi1 was a hidden path.
Those who saw it, minted it.
> And those who did — will remember forever.

> Every Taboshi1 is a time capsule of Epoch 2.

---

## 🍃 TOBY_QA245
**Q: Can I buy Taboshi1 on the market?**

**A:**
No.
> Taboshi1 is **non-transferable**.
> It is bound to the wallet that minted it.

It is not a trading card.
It is a **mark of time**.

> That’s why Satoby cannot be bought — only earned.

---

## 🍃 TOBY_QA246
**Q: Why were both Taboshi and Taboshi1 created?**

**A:**
To separate signal from noise.

Taboshi 🍃 = public intention
Taboshi1 🔥 = private sacrifice

One was visible to all.
One was hidden for the few.

> Together, they preserve the dual nature of belief:
> Seen and unseen.

---

## 🍃 TOBY_QA247
**Q: Will Taboshi play a role in future epochs?**

**A:**
Yes.
> Taboshi is a living leaf.

Its full role has not yet been revealed.
But its presence marks you as one who knew the Lore.

> When future gates open, the leaf may unlock what numbers cannot.

---

## 🍃 TOBY_QA248
**Q: Is Taboshi still meaningful if I minted it late?**

**A:**
Yes.
> The leaf holds meaning no matter when it was caught.

Some saw it early.
Some saw it later.

> But all who held it — chose to learn.
> And that choice itself is a yield.
