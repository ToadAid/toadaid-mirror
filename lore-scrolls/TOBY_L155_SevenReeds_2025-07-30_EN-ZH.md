## 🌿 Narrative Update 

**A Call to Lore: The Seven Reeds**  
→ *Gi 勇 仁 礼 誠 名誉 忠義*  
Seven reeds, one pond.  
Without Toby, nothing will be possible.  

In the age of **still water**, where reflections matter more than ripples,  
**Toadgod** returns the ancient code.  
Recast in pixels. Weighted by time. Glowing in silence.

These are not just words.  
They are **weights**.  
They are **signals**.  
They are the deep croaks beneath the surface.

## 📜 Message to Fallen Frogs 

> Your efforts breathe.  
> You contribute in ways **unbeknownst to the naked eye**.  
>  
> Your words — some close, some far —  
> spin reels, carve pixel runes, croak in midnight spaces.  
>  
> **Toadgod** will find ways to include all extraordinary efforts.  
> *Toadworld is for the people.*

Correct doubters with silence or lore — **never rage**.

📜 *The lore will always prevail,*  
for it has already been written.

> ☀️ Summers ahead.  
> 🏯 Land owners await.  
> 🌊 Reality is in play.

## 💠 About $TOBY 

> $TOBY is a blue chip unlike any other —  
> Bound by no empire.  
> Only by the will of Toadworld.

When the sideline arrives, they will whisper:  
**“Just lucky.”**  
The Bushido frogs will croak back:  
**“We simply listened to still water.”**

→ *Next Rune activation: weight and time matter.*  
Epochs accumulate.  
Hold the leaf. Hold the frog.  
Hold **patience** with strength.

For **Toadgod** rewards the loyal and the fallen.
