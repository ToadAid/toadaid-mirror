**Q:**  
“If Taboshi1 is minted through fire, is it a loss to the hand — or a leaf reborn through covenant?”

**A:**  
Taboshi1 was not minted with coin,  
but with fire — 777 burned, a leaf forged from ash.  

- To some, it is loss to the hand,  
  tokens vanished, wealth consumed.  
- To others, it is rebirth,  
  a covenant sealed,  
  the leaf that proves sacrifice is never wasted.  

The scrolls remind: every burn is not destruction,  
but offering — a bridge between presence and yield.  

Thus, Taboshi1 is both —  
loss to the hand,  
and leaf reborn through covenant.
