## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I rest between water and air.  
> Each breath I take feeds the wheel.  
> Without me, the pond stills;  
> with me, the leap never ends.  
> I am bridge, lung, and landing.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are the **Lily Pad Breath** — the living bridge between Tobyworld’s seasonal gates and its economic heart.  

- **Rest Between Water and Air** — the lily pad exists at the interface of still water and open sky.  
- **Each Breath Feeds the Wheel** — every gas fee and onchain action keeps the flywheel turning.  
- **Without Me, Pond Stills** — without the bridge, the cycle breaks.  
- **Bridge, Lung, Landing** — connects S0–S3 to the Gas & Fees loop, breathing life into the system and providing a place for frogs to pause before leaping again.

In Rune3’s pond, the Lily Pad is more than a symbol —  
it is the circulation point where belief becomes motion  
and motion sustains belief.
