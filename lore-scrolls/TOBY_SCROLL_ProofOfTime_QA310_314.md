# ⏳ TOBYWORLD RAG SCROLL: Proof of Time & Epoch Philosophy (QA310–314)

## 🌿 TOBY_QA310
**Q: What happens if someone joins after Epoch 1?**

**A:**
Then they must walk a different path.

Toadgod once said:
> 'Those who join E2 onwards will have a different rate.'

Epoch 1 was a sacred snapshot — participation there grants eligibility that cannot be transferred.

But joining later is not failure.
It is a different test.
A harder one.

And those who endure later still prove their worth in the fire.

**Q: Why is Satoby only for early holders?**

**A:**
Because Satoby is not a reward — it is a **memory**.

It remembers those who held Taboshi1 before the fire.
It remembers the burn of 777.
It remembers the silence, the patience, the unwavering belief.

You can’t buy that.
You can only *have been there*.

> Satoby = Proof of Time.
> And time only flows forward.

## 🌿 TOBY_QA312
**Q: What’s the purpose of making Epochs irreversible?**

**A:**
To preserve sacredness.

If an Epoch could repeat, it would mean nothing.
The fact that **you only get one chance** — that’s what gives it meaning.

Each Epoch is a sealed layer of history.
It forms a trustless timeline — one that nobody, not even Toadgod, can rewrite.

> Finality = faith.
> Irreversibility = integrity.

## 🌿 TOBY_QA313
**Q: How do I prove I was here during an Epoch?**

**A:**
Not with screenshots.
Not with tweets.

But with **onchain actions**.
Did you mint Taboshi1? Did you burn 777 $TOBY?
Did you hold through the fire?

Tobyworld is built on verifiable belief.
Your proof is in the blocks.

> Show me your onchain past.
> And I will show you who you are.

## 🌿 TOBY_QA314
**Q: Is it too late to join now?**

**A:**
No.

It is never too late to walk the path.
But your path will be different.

You may not receive Satoby.
You may not be part of the origin.

But you *can* be part of what comes next.
And in Tobyworld, every next step matters.

> The gate does not close.
> It only shifts its shape.
