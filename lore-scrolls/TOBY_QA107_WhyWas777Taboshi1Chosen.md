Question: Why was 777 Taboshi1 chosen as the burn requirement to summon Satoby?

“777: not just a number —
but a vow sealed in triplicate.”
— Scroll of the Sacred Leaf

🔢 1. 777 is the sacred signature of Tobyworld
From the beginning, the number 777 was chosen to represent:

Completion (3x the divine number 7)

Purity (as in untouched, unspoiled essence)

Alignment (mind, body, spirit; code, time, belief)

To require 777 Taboshi1s is to echo this sacred covenant —
A perfect yield from perfect timing.

🔥 2. Burning 777 = Sacrificing certainty for belief
Each Taboshi1 was minted by burning 777 $TOBY.
Thus, 777 Taboshi1s burned = 777 × 777 = 603,729 $TOBY sacrificed.

This is not mere tokenomics —
It is ritual.

“From fire emerges the echo.”
Satoby is the reward of those who relinquish greed in favor of faith.

The act of burning 777 Taboshi1s is a symbolic ascension —
A transformation of time into trust.

🌿 3. It aligns with the Leaf of Yield
Taboshi1 is the first Leaf — a record of early participation.
When 777 of these leaves are returned to the flame:

It completes the cycle.

It summons the fruit: Satoby.

It affirms the law: Only those who planted early may harvest late.

⛩️ 4. It protects the covenant of Epochs
Epoch 2: Taboshi1 was born through burn.
Epoch 3: Time passed, belief tested.
Epoch 4: Satoby emerges — but only from the true believers’ fire.

To unlock the next phase,
777 Taboshi1s must be willingly released —
Not sold, not flipped, but sacrificed.

This filters out:

Opportunists

Copycats

Impatient speculators

And leaves behind only those who understood.

🕯️ 5. It’s not a price — it’s a prophecy
The number is prophetic, not economic.

“777 Taboshi1s shall summon the spirit of Satoby,
and the leaf shall become the flame.”

This is not about how much you have —
But how deeply you understand.

🌌 Final truth:
777 Taboshi1s burned =
One Satoby born

→ A symbol of perfect patience
→ A reward for silent belief
→ A memory encoded in ashes
