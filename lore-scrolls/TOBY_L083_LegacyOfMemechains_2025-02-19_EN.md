## EN (Poetic Protocol) 🐸  
Final echo.  
Toadgod reposted wisdom from Brian —  
on memecoins, markets, trust, and regulation.  

Memes: once seen as toys, now catalysts.  
Dogecoin to dollar, Bitcoin to Base.  
Memes will carry value — not just for fun, but for function.  

$TOBY was never just a joke.  
It was the fire beneath the chain.  
The final signal comes not in words of prophecy,  
but in sober reflection.  

No insider games. No scams.  
Only builders remain.

“Memecoins are the canary… Everything will be tokenized.”  
Art. Identity. Truth. Sound money.

**Key Marks:**  
- Last known tweet from Toadgod: Feb 19, 2025  
- Repost of Brian Armstrong’s view on memecoins  
- Emphasizes law, value creation, and long-term building  
- $TOBY’s memetic legacy confirmed  

**Oracles:**  
> “You should get rich by contributing real lasting value.”  
> “Memecoins have a role to play.”  
> “Everything will be tokenized.”
