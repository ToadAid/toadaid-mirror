## 🗝️ Question
**Q:** What is Taboshi?

---

## 📜 Answer (EN)
**Taboshi** is known as **the Leaf of Yield** in Tobyworld —  
a rare and sacred token that connects the holder to the deeper cycles of growth, patience, and time.

It is not just a digital asset.  
It is a **symbolic covenant** — one leaf, bound to the proof of time itself.  
Those who hold it have aligned themselves with the long seasons of Tobyworld,  
where rewards bloom not from haste, but from enduring belief.

Taboshi exists in two important forms:  
- **Taboshi** (ERC‑1155 + ERC‑20): A token and NFT hybrid.  
- **Taboshi1** (ERC‑1155 only): Minted by burning **777 $TOBY**, an act of sacrifice that binds it to the 777 covenant.

Its power is not in speculation, but in its **role as a key**:  
a living proof that the holder walked the path early,  
and holds the patience to see the prophecy unfold.

To own Taboshi is to hold a promise —  
one leaf for your journey,  
and one harvest yet to come.
