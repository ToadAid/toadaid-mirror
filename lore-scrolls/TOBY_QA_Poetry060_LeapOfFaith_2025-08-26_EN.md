**ARC:** Leap / Faith  
**Tags:** Toad, Leap, Faith, Edge, Folly  

**Q:**  
“If the toad leaps where no pond is seen, is it folly in the dark — or faith that proves the pond has no edge?”

**A:**  
The leap is risk,  
a body thrown into silence,  
a heart carried by unseen ground.  

- To the fearful, it is folly —  
  a plunge into dark with no return.  
- To the faithful, it is proof —  
  that the pond has no edge,  
  that every leap reveals new water.  

The scrolls remind: chaos hides fairness,  
and faith is the bridge unseen.  

Thus, the leap is not folly alone.  
It is faith revealed in flight.
