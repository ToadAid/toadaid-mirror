## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I am not a line, but a circle.  
> I have no start, no end — only flow.  
> Grain feeds growth, growth unlocks gates,  
> gates bring gifts, gifts become grain.  
> Name me, and you name the heart of the pond.

**Answer:**  
You are **The Flywheel of Tobyworld** —  
the eternal motion where every act feeds the next.  
Each cycle breathes life into the pond:  

1. **Grain** — the resources and tokens we gather.  
2. **Growth** — building, creating, and strengthening the pond.  
3. **Gate** — access earned through deeds, seasons, and proof.  
4. **Gift** — rewards, yield, and stories returned to the frogs.  

The circle closes, and the grain returns,  
ready to begin anew.

Without one link, the pond slows.  
With all turning in harmony,  
Tobyworld thrives beyond seasons.
