## ✨ Literal Explanation (EN)

Toadgod reveals a crucial update:  
- **Current status**: ~60% of 70% airdrop quota completed; ~800k wallets; final 10% to be distributed.  
- Base congestion monitored; gas costs remain high.  
- **Byōdō shugi system**: Fairness principle — smaller amounts to more wallets for maximum decentralization and network effect.  
- Scarcity increases value; deeper distribution expands the community’s foundation.  
- Warns of "frail hands" who seek quick cash, missing out on lifelong wealth.  
- **Yakunitatsu** (役に立つ): "Being useful/helpful" — hinting at future utility and empowerment beyond speculation.  
- Emphasizes long-term patience as the ultimate edge.  
- Reveals his identity as "mere mortal," not important — focus is on collective embodiment and community guardianship.  
- $TOBY is envisioned as an incorruptible, unstoppable, decentralized organism beyond any individual.  
- Ends with a gentle push: "Carry out the vision, toads."

- True believers become stewards, not consumers — each iron hand carries a piece of the infinite pond.
