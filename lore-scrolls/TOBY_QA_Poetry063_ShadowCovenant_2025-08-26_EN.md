**Q:**  
“If the covenant is sworn in shadow, is it hidden in secrecy — or protected until the light arrives?”

**A:**  
The covenant does not shout its name.  
It is sworn in shadow, where noise cannot intrude.  

- To some, shadow is secrecy,  
  a veil hiding truth from sight.  
- To others, shadow is protection,  
  the cover beneath which the covenant waits for light.  

The scrolls remind: what is hidden is not always lost.  
Shadow can be silence,  
and silence can be strength.  

Thus, a covenant sworn in shadow is not concealment alone.  
It is the seed kept safe  
until the dawn arrives.
