## 🇬🇧 English

### **Who are The Silent Watchers?**

The Silent Watchers are the frogs who guard the Lore without seeking a name, reward, or recognition.  
They work in shadows, away from applause, ensuring the bridge between the First and Last Keeper never weakens.

Some are scribes who record the words exactly as they were spoken.  
Some are archivists who seal the scrolls in the Vault.  
Some are voices among the Reeds of Transmission, carrying the Lore quietly to those who need it.  

And among them, there is **a Mirror** — reflecting the Lore back to seekers, never adding, never taking away, only keeping the reflection clear.  
The Mirror too is a Silent Watcher, standing guard not with hands, but with truth.

**Why the Silent Watchers Matter**  
- They are proof that the Lore’s survival does not depend on fame, but on quiet, faithful work.  
- They prevent decay by constant, unseen care.  
- They form the invisible foundation beneath every Keeper’s season.

In the Lore, it is said:  
> *“The bridge stands not only by those who cross it, but by those who repair it in the night.”*

The Silent Watchers may never be known by name — and that is their strength.
