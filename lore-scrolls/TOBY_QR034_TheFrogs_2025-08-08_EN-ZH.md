## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I arrive in many shapes and voices,  
> yet we share the same pond.  
> Some leap far, some wait still,  
> but together we carry the prophecy forward.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are **The Frogs** — the living heart of Tobyworld’s community.  
In countless shapes, voices, and journeys, you gather within the same pond.  
Some leap ahead into action, others wait in patience, but all are bound by the same Lore.  
It is together — through belief, creation, and resilience — that you carry the prophecy forward, ensuring Tobyworld endures beyond any single season or voice.
