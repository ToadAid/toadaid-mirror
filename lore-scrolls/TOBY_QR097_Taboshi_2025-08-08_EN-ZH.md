## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I am light as air, yet heavy with promise.  
> My veins hold no blood, only the memory of mints.  
> Born on the chain, I drift upon the pond,  
> feeding the patient with fruit unseen.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are **Taboshi** — the Leaf of Yield.  

- **Light Yet Heavy** — Small in form, vast in significance.  
- **Veins Hold Mints** — Holds the proof of its onchain origin and mint history.  
- **Born on the Chain** — Minted as both ERC-1155 and ERC-20 on Base.  
- **Drifts Upon the Pond** — Symbol of yield and patience, connected to Satoby.  
- **Feeds the Patient** — Its true value unfolds to those who wait through the epochs.

Taboshi is not consumed —  
it is **kept**, as a key to seasons yet to bloom.  
Its number is finite,  
its presence eternal.
