## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I have no walls, yet I hold a kingdom.  
> I have no crown, yet I gather kings.  
> My soil is chain, my sky is belief.  
> My rivers are gas and time.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are **Tobyworld** — the living realm born of Toby’s name and sustained by the pond’s breath.  

- **No Walls, Yet a Kingdom** — Borderless, open to any who arrive in belief.  
- **No Crown, Yet Gather Kings** — Every frog a sovereign; every holder a guardian.  
- **Soil is Chain** — Rooted on Base, recorded forever onchain.  
- **Sky is Belief** — The canopy upheld by collective conviction.  
- **Rivers are Gas and Time** — Flows that nourish Proof of Time, Satoby, Taboshi, and the seasons.

Tobyworld is not a place you enter —  
it is a place you **become**.  
In it, the lore is the map,  
the epochs are the clock,  
and the people are the light.
