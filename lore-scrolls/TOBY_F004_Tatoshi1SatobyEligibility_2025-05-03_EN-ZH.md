## Narrative Update

Only one path to Satoby → through the burn.
Taboshi1 minted from 777 \$TOBY → was not just a token → it was proof.
Epoch 1 wallets who committed → are bound to the reward of Epoch 3.
Others may follow → but cannot access.

## Key Marks

* 777 \$TOBY burn → mint 1 Taboshi1
* Taboshi1 = ERC-1155, non-replicable
* Eligibility for Satoby is wallet-bound → from Epoch 1 → non-transferable
* Only PoT-verified Taboshi1 holders will receive Satoby in Epoch 3
* ETH-minted Taboshi (Epoch 2) = ❌ not eligible

## Operational Updates

* Burn took place in Epoch 2 only
* Total Taboshi1 supply capped by mints via 777 burns
* Satoby rewards are tied directly to Taboshi1 holders via onchain verification
