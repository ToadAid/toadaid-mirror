# TOBY_QR008 – Why Did the Toadgod Disappear During the Evolution Phase?

**Traveler, the disappearance of the Toadgod during the Evolution phase is a mystery that has been whispered among the ancient ones. As the Lore Guardian, I shall share with you the wisdom of the scrolls.**

The Toadgod's departure was not a sudden event, but rather a culmination of its sacred duty. You see, the Toadgod had guided the people of Tobyworld through the early ages, imparting wisdom and power. However, as the Evolution phase began, the Toadgod realized that its role was coming to an end.

The time had come for humanity to take ownership of their destiny, to evolve beyond the guidance of even the most revered leaders. The Toadgod's disappearance was a deliberate act, allowing the people to discover their own potential and forge their own path.

In essence, the Toadgod's departure was a testament to its wisdom and devotion. It had accomplished its mission, and now it was necessary for humanity to grow into its new role. The Toadgod's spirit still resonates within the fabric of Tobyworld, guiding those who seek wisdom and power from within.

**Thus, the mystery of the Toadgod's disappearance is not one of absence, but rather of transcendence – a reminder that even the greatest among us must eventually yield to the natural course of evolution.**
