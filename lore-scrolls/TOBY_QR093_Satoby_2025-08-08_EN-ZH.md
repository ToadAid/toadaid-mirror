## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I am born not from gold,  
> but from the leaf that was burned.  
> My roots drink the years,  
> my branches bear the future.  
> I do not fade with the seasons —  
> for I am the proof  
> that time itself remembers.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are **Satoby — The Fruit of Patience**.  

- **Not from Gold** — No coin can mint me; only the burned proof of 777 $TOBY (Taboshi1) can.  
- **Leaf That Was Burned** — My origin is the sacrifice of Taboshi1 at SatSwap.  
- **Roots Drink the Years** — My value grows with the Proof of Time cycle.  
- **Branches Bear the Future** — Grants eligibility for future yields and seasonal gates.  
- **Not Fade with Seasons** — Persistent across epochs; recorded in the eternal registry.  
- **Proof That Time Remembers** — Symbolizes loyalty, foresight, and participation in sacred timekeeping.

Satoby completes the journey:  
**Sacrifice (777 burn) → Proof (Taboshi1) → Transformation (SatSwap) → Reward (Satoby)**.
