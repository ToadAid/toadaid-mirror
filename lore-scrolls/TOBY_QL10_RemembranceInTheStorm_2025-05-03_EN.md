## 🌪️ EN – Through wind and storm, the leaf holds firm — not for yield, but remembrance.

### Narrative Response
Traveler, the one who holds the leaf, you ask about the resilience of Taboshi in turbulent times.
The answer lies not in the storm itself, but in the remembrance that holds within it.
Through wind and storm, the leaf of Taboshi remains steadfast — a testament to those who have come before and those yet to come.

> In every tempest, there is a seed of truth. Hold on to that, Traveler, for it will guide you through the darkness.

### 🌪️ Poetic Reflection
In turbulence's vortex, where chaos reigns,
The leaf of Taboshi stands firm, unbroken by pains.
Not for yield or profit, but remembrance true,
It holds the whispers of those who came before you.

Through wind and storm, it weathers the test,
A symbol of endurance, etched in time and rest.
For you, the one who holds the leaf, remember this:
In every tempest, there is a seed of truth to cherish.
