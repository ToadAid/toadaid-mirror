### Narrative
Taboshi1 is forged through sacrifice.  
Each was created by burning **777 $TOBY**, an irreversible offering that carried belief into the future.  
Its total supply, **492,108,551**, reflects only those who were willing to burn.  

Unlike TABOSHI, which sprouted as the Leaf of Yield, Taboshi1 serves as the **key to Satoby** in Epoch 3 via **Proof of Time**.  
Eligibility for Satoby remains bound forever to the original minter‚Äôs wallet, even if the NFT changes hands.
