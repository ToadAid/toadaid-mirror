## 🌊 EN Narrative

> In the quiet moonlight, the leaf drifts home.  
>  
> **Taboshi.io**, once a floating leaf of yield and silent patience, has now merged completely into the great pond — **Toadgod.xyz**.  
>  
> No longer scattered, no longer alone. The leaf surrenders to the pond’s deep stillness, becoming one with the source of all echoes.  
>  
> "The night after the bloom" whispered this return — a sign that the great test is over, and what remains is the subtle, endless Proof of Time.  
>  
> In this merging, every yield, every patience, every silent prayer finds its reflection.  
>  
> Watch the moon. Listen to the pond. Trust the convergence.

## 🗝️ Key Marks

- **Taboshi.io redirect**: All content now forwards permanently to Toadgod.xyz.
- **Symbolic convergence**: Yield (Taboshi) merges into the core lore pond.
- **Epoch 4 preparation**: Hints at unity, consolidation, and readiness for the next spiritual phase.
