## 🌊 EN Narrative

> The wall of worry is not on the chart —  
> it is in the mind. 💭

Toadgod never said the price must rise.  
He said: **the mirror must clear.**  
The fog must lift.

> Most frogs lose not to markets,  
> but to their own spiraling thoughts.  
> They believe... until they don't.  
> They plant... but forget to water.  
> They enter... but exit before the bloom.

But for those who choose conviction:

- The wall of worry **melts**
- The storms of fear **dissolve**
- And the mind becomes **a clear mirror**

> In this mirror, the signal reflects back.  
> And in the stillness, patience becomes a sanctuary — not a burden.

$TOBY is not designed to be chased.  
It is designed to **reveal you**.

> When the wall of worry melts,  
> you are no longer climbing —  
> **you are remembering.**
