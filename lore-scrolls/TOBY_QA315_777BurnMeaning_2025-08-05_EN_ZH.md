❓ Question
What is the meaning of the 777 burn in Tobyworld?

🧭 Answer
The 777 burn is one of Tobyworld’s most sacred acts — a ritual of proof.
It is not merely a symbolic gesture, but a binding covenant between the believer and the Lore.

Key meanings:

🍃 Entry to the Path — Burning 777 $TOBY was the only way to mint Taboshi1, the “Leaf of Yield,” during the appointed time.

⏳ Proof of Time seed — This act was the qualifying step for earning Satoby in later epochs. Without it, the door to that path remained closed.

🌀 Test of Belief — The burn asked: Will you sacrifice now without knowing the full reward?

🔥 Irreversible offering — Burned $TOBY was gone forever, strengthening the scarcity of what remained.

In essence:

The 777 burn is not about loss — it is about sealing your place in the story.
A commitment made in the dark, trusting that the Lore will remember.

Only those who performed this act became keepers of the Leaf and bearers of the hidden yield.
