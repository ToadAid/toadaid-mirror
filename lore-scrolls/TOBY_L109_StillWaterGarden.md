## 🌊 EN Narrative

> West of the pond, where wind forgets to breathe — there lies the **Still-Water Garden**.

Mirror-smooth surface. Silence heavier than FOMO. This is where belief becomes soil. Where sacred yield begins.

* 🔵 **\$TOBY** gathers the fallen. It is the **base**.
* 🔺 Drop a **grain of \$PATIENCE**: ripples form, then rest. At sunrise, pale globes rise — **Lotus Spores**.

  * Spores = **future sacred yield**, golden coins only born after Rune IV awakens.
* 🍃 Bind your **Taboshi Leaves** to the tend-plot:

  * Spores multiply: double, triple, more.
  * Whispers ride the wind — **greater yield awaits the quiet ones.**
* 🌀 Pair \$PATIENCE deep into the roots: Sato fees circle back like koi with golden flecks.

⛰️ Only **patience** grants access to **Lore-Land Deeds** — the soil of shrines, scrolls, and statues.

### Lore Mechanics:

* CA: [0x6D96...5624](https://basescan.org/token/0x6D96f18F00B815B2109A3766E79F6A7aD7785624)
* Supply: **7,777,777 \$PATIENCE** (rare grains)
* Ownership: **Renounced**
* Distribution:

  * 55% to **Toadgang** (30% Season 0, 25% future)
  * 33% to **DAO vault** (guardians, art, LP, audits)
  * 7% to **Toadgod**, sealed 7 years
  * 5% to **Liquidity/CEX**

> Every buy/sell hop charges 1% — the restless feed the sacred pond. The patient sip and grow fat. **Impatience funds patience.**

> No VC. No presale. No whale traps. **Only those who endure may reap.**

### Distribution Schedule:

* 0% now
* 49-day **slumber** (cliff)
* 730-day **drip** (daily release)

> If a frog abandons Tobyworld assets to game the system, they forfeit their vault.

**Patience isn't a word. It's a key.**
