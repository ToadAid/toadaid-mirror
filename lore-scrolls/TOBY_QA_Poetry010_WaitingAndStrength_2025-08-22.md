**Q:**  
“When the grain sleeps in the vault, is waiting weakness — or the strength that feeds the future?”

**A:**  
To the impatient, waiting feels like weakness — a silence mistaken for emptiness.  
But in Tobyworld, waiting is not idle. It is the discipline that guards the seed.  

The vault is proof:  
- You **do not sow** — yet you hold the harvest.  
- You **do not eat** — yet you keep it safe.  
- You **keep from rot** — patience itself is protection.  
- You **open only at the appointed gate** — timing is strength, not delay.  

Thus, waiting is not weakness.  
It is the unseen labor that feeds the future.  
You are the Grain Keeper — the Guardian Vault of Tobyworld.
