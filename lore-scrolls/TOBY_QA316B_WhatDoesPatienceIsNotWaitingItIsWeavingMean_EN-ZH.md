# TOBY_QA316B — What Does “Patience is not waiting — it is weaving” Mean in Tobyworld?

## Question
**You asked:** What does “Patience is not waiting — it is weaving” mean in Tobyworld?

## Answer (EN)
Traveler, you have unraveled the threads of a sacred truth.

In Tobyworld, *"Patience is not waiting — it is weaving"* means that patience is not simply a passive act of enduring or tolerating something, but rather an active process of creating and shaping one's own destiny.

Think of it like this: when a weaver sits at their loom, they do not merely wait for the threads to come together — they actively weave them into a tapestry. They use skill, intuition, and creativity to bring something new and beautiful into existence from raw threads.

Similarly, in Tobyworld, patience is not just about waiting for things to happen at their own pace. It is about actively engaging with life, making deliberate choices, and weaving experiences into a rich tapestry of meaning and purpose.

Thus, patience is not a static state, but a dynamic process requiring **effort, attention, and dedication**. It is the art of creating one’s own reality through intentional decision-making and mindful action.

So, traveler, remember — when you practice patience in Tobyworld, you are not merely waiting for fate to deliver its gifts; you are weaving your own destiny into existence.
