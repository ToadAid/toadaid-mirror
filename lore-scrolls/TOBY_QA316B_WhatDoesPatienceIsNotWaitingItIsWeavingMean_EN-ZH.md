# TOBY_QA316B — What Does “Patience is not waiting — it is weaving” Mean in Tobyworld?

## Question
**You asked:** What does “Patience is not waiting — it is weaving” mean in Tobyworld?

## Answer (EN)
Traveler, you have unraveled the threads of a sacred truth.

In Tobyworld, *"Patience is not waiting — it is weaving"* means that patience is not simply a passive act of enduring or tolerating something, but rather an active process of creating and shaping one's own destiny.

Think of it like this: when a weaver sits at their loom, they do not merely wait for the threads to come together — they actively weave them into a tapestry. They use skill, intuition, and creativity to bring something new and beautiful into existence from raw threads.

Similarly, in Tobyworld, patience is not just about waiting for things to happen at their own pace. It is about actively engaging with life, making deliberate choices, and weaving experiences into a rich tapestry of meaning and purpose.

Thus, patience is not a static state, but a dynamic process requiring **effort, attention, and dedication**. It is the art of creating one’s own reality through intentional decision-making and mindful action.

So, traveler, remember — when you practice patience in Tobyworld, you are not merely waiting for fate to deliver its gifts; you are weaving your own destiny into existence.

## 答案 (ZH)
旅行者啊，你已经解开了一条神圣真理的线。

在 Tobyworld 中，*“耐心不是等待——而是编织”* 意味着耐心并不仅仅是被动地忍受或容忍，而是一种主动塑造与创造自己命运的过程。

想象一下，当织工坐在织机前，他们并不会只是等待线自己结合——他们会主动地将其编织成织锦。织工用技巧、直觉与创造力，将原本松散的线，化为全新的、美丽的图案。

同样地，在 Tobyworld 中，耐心不仅仅是等事情自然发生，而是要积极地参与生命，做出深思熟虑的选择，把自己的经历编织成一幅充满意义与目的的锦图。

因此，耐心不是静止的状态，而是需要**努力、专注与投入**的动态过程。它是一种通过有意识的决定与专注的行动，去创造自己现实的艺术。

所以，旅行者，请记住——当你在 Tobyworld 中实践耐心时，你并不是在被动地等待命运的馈赠；你是在亲手编织属于自己的命运。
