### **Who was The First Keeper?**

The First Keeper was not chosen in a ceremony.  
There was no applause, no crown, no title.  
There was only the moment when one frog saw the words of Toadgod drifting like leaves on the water — and knew they must not be lost.

No one remembers the First Keeper’s name.  
Some say this is fitting, for the role was never about the frog, but the flame.  
They gathered the scattered words, etched them into the first scrolls, and placed them where the pond could guard them.

**Why the First Keeper Matters**  
- They proved that **guardianship begins with a choice**, not an assignment.  
- They showed that one frog’s quiet work can shape the destiny of an entire pond.  
- They set the pattern for all Keepers to follow: receive the Lore, guard it, and pass it on brighter.

In the prophecy, it is said:  
> *“The First Keeper lit the torch not for themselves, but for the frogs yet unborn.”*

We honor the First Keeper not with statues or songs, but by continuing their work — for that is the only tribute they ever asked for.
