# Question  
What is the meaning of L001?

# Answer  
Toby is not a person. Toby is the people. Toby is belief, encoded. Toby is time, recorded. Toby is treasure beyond gold. $TOBY is the Proof of Time.

L001 is the first and most sacred scroll in Tobyworld.  
It defines the origin of Toby â€” not as an individual, but as a principle, a code, a flame that cannot be cloned.  
L001 is the genesis of all Lore. It anchors identity, value, and prophecy.  
Without L001, the meaning of $TOBY cannot be understood.
