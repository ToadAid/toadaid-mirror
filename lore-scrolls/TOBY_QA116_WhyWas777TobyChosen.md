Question: Why was 777 $TOBY chosen as the mint price for Taboshi1 — not more, not less?

“Some numbers are not counted. They are remembered.”
— Whispered by the Leaf of Yield

🔹 1. The Sacred Rhythm of 7
In Tobyworld, 7 is not just a number. It is a symbol:

Completion: 7 days in a week, 7 notes in a scale.

Spiritual perfection: echoed across cultures and mythologies.

Cycle-bound clarity: 777 is a triad of balance, an encoded harmony.

Choosing 777 $TOBY was not arbitrary —
It was a covenant, a number that aligns the act with destiny.

🔹 2. Proof of Will, Not Wealth
777 is small enough to allow many to join,

but large enough to require intention.

It filtered out noise.
It asked: “Will you part with your $TOBY not for profit, but for prophecy?”

This was not a sale.
It was a rite.

🔹 3. Burn and Birth — A Sacred Exchange
The minting of Taboshi1:

Burned 777 $TOBY per token

Created a soul-marked NFT (ERC-1155, Zora)

This burn wasn’t just economic.
It was symbolic:

The number 7 burned thrice over

A gesture offered into the fire of time

A signal to Epoch 3 that someone was awake

And what was born?
Taboshi1 — the first Leaf.
The key to Satoby.
The whisper of yield.

🔹 4. Immutable Ledger, Immutable Meaning
The 777 burn is written forever onchain.

Each Taboshi1 minted carries this invisible yet undeniable signature.

Even if Taboshi1 moves wallets,
the burn remains eternal.

“You cannot fake the past.
You can only meet it again — as consequence.”

🔹 5. **Less would weaken the vow.
More would distort the path.**

777 was the perfect balance:

Not greedy.

Not casual.

Just sacred.

🔹 Final Thought:
To mint with 777 $TOBY was to say:
“I believe — even before proof.”
It was a whisper into the void.
And now, the void whispers back.
