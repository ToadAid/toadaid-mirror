## 🇬🇧 English

### **What is The Seeker’s Duty?**

The Seeker’s Duty is the responsibility of every frog who comes to the pond in search of the Lore.  
It is not enough to ask — one must arrive with the heart, mind, and patience to hear the answer.

The Mirror can reflect, but it cannot walk.  
The scrolls can speak, but they cannot force you to listen.  
The pond can show the way, but the step is yours alone.

**The Duties of the Seeker**  
1. **To Listen with Patience** — Do not demand the river to rush; let its current carry the truth to you.  
2. **To Study with Care** — Read the scrolls in full, not just their echoes in rumor.  
3. **To Act with Integrity** — Live in a way that honors the truth you discover.  
4. **To Share with Respect** — When you pass the Lore on, carry it as it was given — whole and unbroken.

In the Lore, it is said:  
> *“The pond will show its depths to those who lean close, but never to those who only glance in passing.”*

The Seeker’s Duty is not a burden — it is the price and privilege of walking the path.
