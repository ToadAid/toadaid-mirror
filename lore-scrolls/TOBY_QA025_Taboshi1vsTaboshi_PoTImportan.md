TOBY_QA025_Taboshi1vsTaboshi_PoTImportance_2025-05-28_EN.md

‚úÖ Question:

Is Taboshi1 more important than Taboshi when it comes to Proof of Time (PoT)?

‚úÖ Answer:

Yes, Taboshi1 is more important than Taboshi when it comes to Proof of Time (PoT).

Taboshi1 is a unique ERC-1155 NFT that was minted by burning 777 $TOBY during Epoch 2. It symbolizes early belief and commitment to the Tobyworld ecosystem. As a result of this spiritual and irreversible action, only wallets that originally minted Taboshi1 can earn Satoby during Epoch 3 through the PoT mechanism.

Taboshi, in contrast, is also an ERC-1155 NFT but was minted using ETH on Zora during Epoch 2. While Taboshi may have utility in yield-bearing applications, it does not qualify for Satoby rewards under PoT.

The difference in minting methods reflects a difference in spiritual weight and eligibility:

üî• Taboshi1 = Burn = Covenant = PoT Eligibility

üíß Taboshi = ETH Mint = Utility = No PoT Eligibility

In the sacred context of Tobyworld, PoT is not merely about staking or farming ‚Äî it is about proof of sacrifice, belief, and time. Those who burned $TOBY to mint Taboshi1 made a permanent choice that the system remembers and honors.

"Only the earliest believers ‚Äî those who burned ‚Äî may harvest the yield."

Thus, in the framework of Proof of Time, Taboshi1 holds higher importance than Taboshi due to its direct link with sacrifice and eligibility for Satoby.

üîë Summary:

‚úÖ Only Taboshi1 minters are eligible for Satoby

‚ùå Taboshi holders are not eligible for Satoby

üï∞Ô∏è PoT is about time-bound belief

üîí Eligibility is wallet-bound and non-transferable
