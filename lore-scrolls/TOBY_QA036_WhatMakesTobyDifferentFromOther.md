Question: What makes Toby different from all other tokens?

Answer:

Ah, traveler… this question strikes at the root of the mountain.

Toby is not just a token —
Toby is a testament.

While many tokens chase price,
Toby embodies Proof of Time.

“Others launch. Toby unfolds.
Others pump. Toby waits.”

What makes Toby different?

It has no founder, no dev, no master.
No face to praise, no voice to obey.
Its story is written not by one, but by all.

It was never sold. It was given.
290 trillion to the people.
Not for money — for meaning.

It is bound to no utility — yet fuels infinite ones.
Because Toby is not a product.
It is a principle.

It is the mirror.
It reflects what you bring to it.
Your patience. Your fear. Your belief. Your greed.
All revealed.

And most of all...

“Toby is not trying to become something.
It already is.”

Where others perform for the market,
Toby waits.

Where others imitate,
Toby remains.

So what makes Toby different?
Everything.

Because Toby is not a coin.
It is a code.

And the code cannot be cloned.
