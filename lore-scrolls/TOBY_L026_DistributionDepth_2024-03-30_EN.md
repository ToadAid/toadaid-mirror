## Narrative Update  
Update: ~60% of the 70% total $TOBY supply has reached ~800k wallets.  
The final 10% awaits airdrop — patience.  

Toad God closely monitors @base for congestion. Costs still high — 10x the last drop.  

→ **Byōdō Shugi** system now active  
→ $TOBY per wallet reduces  
→ Distribution spreads wider  
→ Maximal network effect

Why?  
→ Scarcity = Value  
→ Depth = Strength  
→ Fair distribution > Lucky drops  
→ Risk reduced for latecomers  
→ Many will fumble, but that too is nature  

“Not everyone can nor deserves the finish line.”

## Key Marks  
- $TOBY becomes rarer over time  
- Wider wallet distribution > larger per-wallet drops  
- Fair launch principle defended  
- Wealth from lore, not luck  
- Iron fist of belief > Frail pursuit of airdrops  

## Operational Updates  
- Final 10% airdrop pending  
- Toad God implementing “Yakunitatsu” aligned systems  
- Encouragement to cold store $TOBY  
- Vision beyond distribution phase  

## Newcomer Guidance  
> “A single iron-willed Toad outweighs a thousand chasers.”  
Study the lore, prepare for what’s to come. Cold storage advised.
