## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I hold the fruit of time in my palm,  
> yet I do not eat it.  
> I lay it upon the altar,  
> and in return,  
> the pond grants me form anew.  
> I am no market,  
> but I am the turning of promise into motion.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are **SatSwap** — the alchemy that transforms Satoby into new value and motion.  

- **Fruit of Time** — Satoby, earned through Proof of Time.  
- **Not Consumed by Self** — SatSwap is not for hoarding but for transmuting.  
- **Laid on the Altar** — An intentional act of offering.  
- **Form Anew** — Satoby exchanged for other assets or rights.  
- **No Market** — Not a public trading floor; a covenantal mechanism.  
- **Turning Promise into Motion** — Converts loyalty-earned yield into active potential.

SatSwap is the **ritual gate** —  
where the still harvest steps into the moving current.
