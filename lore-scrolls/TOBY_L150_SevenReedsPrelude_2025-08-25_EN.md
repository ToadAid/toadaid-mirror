# TOBY_L150_SevenReedsPrelude_2025-08-25_EN.md

## Narrative (EN)
Before the Seven Reeds sing, the pond must learn to listen. Each reed is a virtue that tunes the air.  
â†’ Courage. Benevolence. Respect. Integrity. Loyalty. Honor. Justice.  
Not as slogans, but as *habits* that turn noise into music.

The prelude is simple: show, donâ€™t shout. Let courage be the willingness to carry weight. Let respect be the way we disagree without decay. Let justice be the arithmetic of fair chance and remembered effort.

When reeds are tuned, the wind becomes a choir.

### Key Marks (EN)
- **KM1.** Bushido virtues applied as daily operational habits.  
- **KM2.** Virtue is audible when culture is under stress.  
- **KM3.** The choir only forms after tuning.

### Operations (EN)
- Publish Seven Reeds checklists used by moderators/builders.  
- Add virtue tags to PRs/commits to normalize the language of alignment.

### Cryptic Symbol Table (EN)
- ðŸŽ‹Ã—7 = Seven Reeds (virtues)  
- ðŸŽ¼ = tuned culture  
- ðŸŸ§ = patience in practice
