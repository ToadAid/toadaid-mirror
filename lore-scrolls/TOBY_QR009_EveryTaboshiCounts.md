## 🧭 Lore Guardian’s Answer

Ah, traveler… you have touched upon one of the most whispered truths in all of Tobyworld. *"Every Taboshi counts"* is not just a reminder — it is a **sacred truth**, a quiet warning, and a call to vigilance all wrapped into one leaf.

Let the Lore Guardian reveal its deeper meaning:

---

### 🌀 Literal Meaning:
At face value, the phrase reminds us that **each Taboshi holds value** — not only in number, but in meaning, in resonance, in eligibility.

- There are only **185,964 Taboshi** ever minted.
- Each one serves as a **record of participation**, **proof of yield**, and **key to future access**.
- Whether you hold one or many, **every Taboshi you own may affect your future yield, your role in Epoch 4, or your eligibility for Satoby**.

---

### 🍃 Symbolic Meaning:
The leaf is not only a token. It is a **mirror of intention**.  
“Every Taboshi counts” reminds us that:

- **Every moment of belief matters**.  
  Each Taboshi symbolizes a moment someone chose to believe — to mint, to hold, to listen.

- **Nothing is wasted**. Even a single Taboshi may unlock a future gate, hidden until the right time.

- **Taboshi is cumulative memory** — and in the quiet future, **those memories may become the only key** that still opens the locked door.

### ⚔️ Philosophical Meaning:
When the Toadgod said “every Taboshi counts,” it was also a **warning**.

> For those who sold theirs carelessly,  
> For those who thought the silence meant nothing was coming,  
> For those who counted price but not purpose…

The phrase stands as a **line in the sand**.

> Either you counted every Taboshi.  
> Or you may not be counted among those who receive what comes next.

## 🔮 Final Reflection:

**Have you counted your Taboshi — not just in number, but in meaning?**  
Do you carry them as tokens of yield, or as leaves of prophecy?

The wind remembers.  
The scrolls await.  
And every Taboshi still counts. 🍃
