## 🌌 Prelude — Night After the Bloom 

- **EN:** No sun. No stars. Only velvet dark. Most frogs chased quick riches; the **snapshot** came *after* the sell-the-news to reveal the **true believers**. One blue frog did not leap — **it remained still** and spoke: “**We move not by leaps. We move by stillness.**”  
---

## 🏛️ Hidden Geometry of Runes 

- **Rune I:** burned over a year ago — the **baptism of the pond**.  
- **Rune II:** **Taboshi** sprouted — the **Leaf of Yield**.  
- **Rune III:** **Patience** unfurls at dawn.  
- **When all four glow, Tobyworld ascends** from pond → continent.

---

## 🎐 Ceremony of the Jade Chest 

- Keeper unveils a **jade chest** with **7,777,777 grains** of $PATIENCE.  
- **1,254 grains** are carefully allocated to the **most loyal**.  
- **Season 0 (s0):** **1,800 loyal frogs** receive **vaults** totaling **~2.32M $PATIENCE**.  
- **7-week cliff** → then a **730-day** slow river (daily drip) — **a sip, never a gulp**.  
- **3-day claim** window starting **Jul 17, 2025**. **Unclaimed** → **Guard Vault (multisig)**.

---

## 🪷 Still-Water Garden & Lotus Spores 

- West bank lies the **Still-Water Garden** — silence thicker than FOMO.  
- Drop a **🔺 grain of PATIENCE** → one ripple sleeps → next sunrise: **Lotus Spores** (= **yield**).  
- **Bind Taboshi 🍃** to your tend-plot → **spores multiply**.  
- Pair **PATIENCE** to deepen roots; **🌀 sato fees** swirl back like koi with gold flakes.  
- **Only the patient gardeners** will qualify for **Lore-Land deeds**.

---

## ⚙️ Mechanics 

- **Supply:** 7,777,777 $PATIENCE (rare grains).  
- **Allocations:** **Community 55%** (≈30% s0, **25% future seasons**), **DAO-Vault 33%** (guardians, artists, bridges, audits, LP rewards), **Toadgod 7%** (*locked 7 years*), **Liquidity/CEX 5%*.  
- **Tax/Flywheel:** **1% fee** on each buy/sell **redistributes to holders** → **the impatient reward the patient** (deflation into steady hands).  
- **Vesting (Vaults):** **0% today → 49-day slumber (7 weeks) → 730-day drip**.  
- **Integrity:** **No VC**, **no presale**, **bot wards** at the gates; **patience is earned**.

---

## 🧿 Oath & Warnings 

- **Oath:** “Toadgod seals 7% for **seven winters**; loyalty without sacrifice is wind.”  
  **Tx (7-year lock):** https://basescan.org/tx/0xe79076adaf3163191f3d32179e4cd94996092fc78199d35674d01592538732e9  
- **Warning:** **Qualifying frogs who abandon Tobyworld assets** to game the system **forfeit** their assigned vault.

---

## 🔺 Symbolic Meaning 

- **Triangle (🔺):** trial of endurance; strength in balance.  
- **Patience Fruit:** bitter seed → sweet harvest.  
- **Mirror Mind:** when the mind is still, **reality becomes magnet**.


---

## 🧭 Distribution Seasons 

- **Season 0 (s0):** **Jul 17** vaults unlock — **~2.32M $PATIENCE** to the loyal (1,800 frogs).  
- **Season 1:** LP guardians.  
- **Season 2:** Tobyworld artists.  
- **Season 3:** TWPOT builders (bridge-forgers, quest-weavers).  
- **Later seasons:** **unscripted** — unpredictability is fair.


---

## 🧠 Seed of Doubt / Seed of Glory 

- **Cycle mantra:** *FUD → FOMO → Cope → Euphoria → Repeat*.  
- **Short-gain price = long-wealth missed**; transfer happens **mind-to-mind**, not wallet-to-wallet.  
- Choose **doubt** → harvest **dust**. Choose **glory** → harvest **gold**.


---

## 🧩 Mechanics Flow (Flywheel)

**PATIENCE → Lotus Spores (Yield) → Taboshi 🍃 (Amplify) → 🌀 Sato Fees (Return) → Lore-Land Deeds → Scarcity → Community Strength → Back to PATIENCE**

## 🕯️ Invocation

**勇・仁・礼・誠・名誉・忠義**  
Seven reeds, one pond.  
Without Toby, nothing is possible.  

---

## 🌱 The Seven Reeds 

- **勇 (Courage):** To leap when all others freeze.  
- **仁 (Compassion):** To tend the pond, not just oneself.  
- **礼 (Respect):** To honor frog and foe alike.  
- **誠 (Integrity):** To keep word as bond, even in silence.  
- **名誉 (Honor):** To bear ridicule, yet stand unbent.  
- **忠義 (Loyalty):** To hold the line, patient in storm.  

Seven reeds bend, but never break. Together they form the raft on which Tobyworld sails.  

---


## 🔮 Symbolic Meaning

- **Seven reeds = Bushido code transposed into frog-lore.**  
- **Pond = unity**; reeds individually fragile, together unbreakable.  
- **Virtues anchor patience**, transforming $PATIENCE from grain → kingdom.
