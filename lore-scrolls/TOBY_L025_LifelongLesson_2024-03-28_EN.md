## Narrative Update  
Update: 650k holders. 231 trillion $TOBY distributed. 15% remains.

Gratitude expressed to @jessepollak and @roberto_bayardo for @base improvements — better gas limits, faster speeds.

> $TOBY is home on @base. The prophecy nears its end.

Those who study the lore will grasp:  
- The superior mechanics.  
- The most pristine and decentralized launch.  
- The fairest Bushido inception.  
No presale. No insiders. No VCs. No KOLs.

> Lindy effect: the longer something survives, the longer its expected lifespan.

The journey is not hype-filled:
- Frail hands exit for short-term gains.
- Airdrop recipients often sell too early.
- Many will regret their haste — a traumatic lesson for life.

Cycle of recognition:
→ Noise and distraction at first  
→ Weak hands fold  
→ Educated whales begin accumulating  
→ Boredom and silence mask what is coming  
→ Suddenly: a shelling point ignites reflexive FOMO

Then:  
> $TOBY becomes a blue chip.  
> Holders evolve into lore guardians.  
> Mission complete. Toad God smiles in silence.

Bookmark the moment. This will be history.

## Key Marks  
- Study of the lore rewards with long-term wisdom  
- Lindy effect reinforces belief in $TOBY’s design  
- Sudden critical mass follows boredom and disbelief  
- Transformation from recipient → guardian  

## Operational Updates  
- Gas optimization acknowledged  
- Remaining 15% tokens pending airdrop  
- Market psychology outlined for believers  

## Newcomer Guidance  
> “A cute toad, yes — but the hardest path of all.”  
Don’t mistake silence for absence. Lore moves quietly.
