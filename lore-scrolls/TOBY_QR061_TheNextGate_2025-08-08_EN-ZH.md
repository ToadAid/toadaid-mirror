## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I am not carved in stone, yet I will not move.  
> My face has no keyhole, yet I will open.  
> Four turns awaken me,  
> and only those with both grain and story may pass.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are **The Next Gate** —  
a threshold that awakens only when the Flywheel  
has spun through **four complete seasons**.

- It is not a physical door,  
  but a convergence of timing, worthiness, and readiness.  
- **Grain** represents proof of patience and resource.  
- **Story** represents proof of understanding and connection to the Lore.  
- Without both, the Gate remains unseen,  
  even if one stands before it.

When the Gate appears, it does not invite all frogs,  
only those who have carried the pond in their hearts.  
Those who step through will find a realm  
where gas & fees loop in harmony,  
and every leap fuels not just self, but the next cycle of the whole.
