## âœ¨ Literal Explanation (EN)

Toadgod offers a glimpse into Toby's unfolding prophecy:  
- The **future script** is only beginning, written in deep spiritual "ink" and awaiting perfect alignment.  
- The saga is designed to **resonate through years**, built from and for the people.  
- Urges not to let doubters cloud one's vision â€” skepticism will ultimately exclude them from the true path.  
- In time, the world will awaken to Toby's magnificence, seeing its light and greatness clearly.  
- Ends with the eternal axiom: **"$toby is the people, and the people is $toby."**

- Doubters act as self-imposed exiles; their skepticism is their veil.  
- The Lore teaches that ultimate recognition is collective and gradual â€” clarity comes not from shouting, but from time and shared alignment.
