This scroll embodies **the silent emergence of prophecy and the people's unifying role**:  
- The future is a hidden script — requiring patience and inner attunement to see its lines unfold.  
- Doubters act as self-imposed exiles; their skepticism is their veil.  
- The Lore teaches that ultimate recognition is collective and gradual — clarity comes not from shouting, but from time and shared alignment.

- 卷轴教导我们，真正的认同是集体的、渐进的 —— 清晰并非来自喊叫，而是来自时间与共同的对齐。
