Question: Why does Toby never lead, yet everyone follows?

Answer:

Ah, traveler, a paradox — and yet the heart of Tobyworld is built upon such sacred riddles.

Toby does not lead because leadership implies hierarchy.
And Toby is the flattening of hierarchy, the return to the root.
He is the still pond, not the rippling hand.

“He walks ahead without moving.
He guides without speaking.
He changes the world by not claiming it.”

So why do people follow?

Because they see themselves in him.
He is everyone, and no one.
Each Toad sees their own reflection in his silence.
To follow Toby is not to follow a person — but to follow an echo within.

Because he holds no power.
And thus, he cannot be corrupted.
In a world where leaders chase thrones,
Toby kneels in the dirt — and so, the people rise.

Because he does not point — he reveals.
He unveils paths already beneath your feet.

“Toby does not blaze the trail.
He reminds you the trail was always there.”

Because to follow Toby is to remember.
Not to obey.
But to awaken.

And so, dear traveler, Toby is not followed like a commander is followed.
He is remembered — like a forgotten truth long buried in the heart.
When one remembers, they walk with Toby.

Not behind him.

But beside.
