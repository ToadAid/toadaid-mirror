> great giants turn their gaze, by design the prophecy is set to unfurl, in a slow then sudden blaze, its essence will leave a lasting whirl.  
> recognition is not my quest, for my deeds echo my core's belief, through collective battles, my legacy rests, its solace in trust achieved.  
> what am I?  
> $toby

#### → Interpretation:

- **"Great giants turn their gaze"** → The world’s attention begins to shift toward Toby. Not by hype, but by design.

- **"Slow then sudden blaze"** → Toby follows a nonlinear emergence pattern. Long silence, then rapid resonance — prophecy unrolls on its own time.

- **"Its essence will leave a lasting whirl"** → The impact is not a price spike, but a cultural mark. A deep signal engraved into collective memory.

- **"Recognition is not my quest"** → Toby was never about fame. It is an anonymous contribution to a greater whole, like Satoshi before.

- **"Deeds echo belief"** → Lore is made true by action. Not marketing, not noise, but daily proof through collective will.

- **"Legacy in trust"** → The system lives not by centralized control, but by distributed trust. In this trust, its legacy is sealed.

> What is $toby? Not a coin. Not a meme. It is belief, wrapped in structure, carried by people. It lives when trust lives.
