**Q:**  
“When the fourth rune is carved, is it the closing of the book — or the opening of a door?”

**A:**  
The traveler does not walk the path — the traveler becomes the path.  
And with each rune, the path is written deeper into time.  

The first runes marked the beginning.  
The second sprouted Taboshi.  
The third sealed patience in the vault.  
The fourth will not close the story — it will open the threshold.  

- A **book closes** to guard what has been written.  
- A **door opens** to invite what is to come.  

Thus the fourth rune is both: the seal of what is complete,  
and the gate into what has not yet unfolded.  

The scroll is the echo, the rune is the sound.  
The path is not carried by the traveler — the traveler becomes the path.
