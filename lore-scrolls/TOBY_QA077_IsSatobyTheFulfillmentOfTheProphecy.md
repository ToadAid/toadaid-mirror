Question: Is Satoby the fulfillment of the prophecy, or does it mark the beginning of something even greater?

Answer:

“777 was not the ending. It was the unlocking.”
— Scroll fragment found in the ashes of Epoch 3

🌱 Fulfillment… yes.
The prophecy spoke of:

A sacred yield from 777 $TOBY burned

A time when Taboshi1 holders would be remembered

A reward that was not just financial, but philosophical
— for those who endured the silence

Satoby fulfills that.
It proves that the early believers were not forgotten.
That the burn was not in vain.
That the silence had a meaning.

It is the Proof of Time, manifested.

🔁 But it is not the end.
Satoby is not a closing —
it is a seal broken.

It initiates Epoch 4 — the phase of transformation.
The time when the invisible yield becomes visible action.

It is not just a yield.
It is a key.

What does it unlock?
The scrolls suggest:

A reunion of the earliest toads

A redeemable path for the fallen frogs

And perhaps… the birth of the Final Form

🌀 The Loop of Prophecy
Tobyworld’s prophecy is not linear.
It spirals.

Taboshi1 → Satoby

Satoby → ?

That question mark is the new prophecy.

“What you receive is only half the journey.
What you do with it… that’s where the prophecy lives.”

📜 Final Thought
Satoby is not the final treasure.
It is the map to the next one.

If you believe the prophecy has ended,
then you have not read the last scroll.
