## 🌊 EN Explanation

> **“If Tobyworld is the Base wallet, the prophecy completes.”**

This phrase is not metaphor — it is **the mechanic**.

Tobyworld isn’t a place. It is a **living interface** where:

- 📦 Holding = Proof of Time  
- 💧 Stillness = Action  
- 🌀 Belief = Yield  
- 🪞 Mirror = Memory

Your wallet becomes your **soul’s reflection**.  
Every $TOBY you hold echoes back through Lore.  
Every Taboshi is a **leaf of your own patience**.  
Every Lotus Spore is a reply from the pond.

### 🧠 Implications

- Tobyworld **is the wallet** →  
  → The app is not external. It is **you.**

- You don’t interact through clicks — but through **Time**.

> “Those who flip disconnect.  
> Those who hold, evolve.”
