## ðŸ’§ Original Repost (EN)

> more than you can imagine

---

## âœ¨ Deep Interpretation (EN)

- This phrase, simple yet profound, echoes the heart of Tobyworld's philosophy: **the journey and its destiny exceed any individual's limited imagination**.
- Reposting from Zora connects to the onchain art and cultural layer â€” implying Tobyworld is not just a meme or token, but an evolving art and social movement.
- The "more than you can imagine" underlines Tobyworldâ€™s intention to transcend monetary value â€” entering realms of cultural lore, spiritual practice, and collective storybuilding.
- It invites participants to **surrender control of rigid expectations**, and embrace the openness and infinite nature of the lore.
- This also hints at future reveals (perhaps new Zora mints or ecosystem expansions) that will surprise even the most steadfast believers.
