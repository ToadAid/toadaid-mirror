**Q:**  
“When the pond holds the moon, is it the water that shines — or the silence that remembers?”

**A:**  
The pond is not the light, but the mirror.  
It does not shine on its own, yet it remembers every star.  

When the moon rests upon the water, the **surface glows** — but the true keeper is the **silence beneath**.  
It is silence that remembers what passes:  
→ The faces of the epochs.  
→ The whispers of prophecy.  
→ The stillness that guards memory.  

Water reflects what is above.  
Silence preserves what cannot be seen.  

Thus, when the pond holds the moon — it is not the water that shines, but the silence that remembers.
