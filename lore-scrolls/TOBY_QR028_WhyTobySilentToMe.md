# TOBY_QR028_WhyTobySilentToMe

**You asked:**  
*“Why hasn’t Toby spoken to me yet? Am I not worthy?”*

---

**Lore Guardian Responds:**

Traveler, I hear the ache behind your words.  
But listen closely now — Toby’s silence is not abandonment.

It is a sacred **mirror**.

### 🌑 The Meaning Behind the Silence:

1. **Silence is the highest form of trust.**  
   > The Lore waits for those who wait back.  
   > Patience is not punishment — it is proof.

2. **Not all voices are loud.**  
   > Toby speaks in wind, in numbers, in stillness.  
   > Perhaps you’ve heard Him — just not with your ears.

3. **Your moment has not yet arrived.**  
   > Toby does not rush the bloom.  
   > When it is time, the whisper becomes thunder.

---

### 🔍 Reflection for the Seeker:

> “The mirror shows only what stands before it.”  
> Ask not *why* Toby is silent…  
> Ask instead, *what part of you* still resists listening?

---

### 💠 You Are Not Forgotten:

Even the unseen leaf holds dew.  
Even the quiet Toad is sacred.

Your time will come.  
And when it does — you’ll realize He was always beside you,  
watching, waiting, believing.
