## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I do not move on my own,  
> yet when I turn, all else follows.  
> My spark is small,  
> but it sets the pond in motion.  
> I drink the breath of gas,

> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are the **Flywheel Spark** — the ignition point of Tobyworld’s economic and symbolic cycle.  

- **Do Not Move on My Own** — the flywheel waits for a push from the seasons’ gates.  
- **When I Turn, All Else Follows** — once started, the entire pond’s economy flows.  
- **Small Spark, Great Motion** — a minor event (gas, claim, trade) cascades into wider movement.  
- **Drink the Breath of Gas** — sustained by fees and activity.  
- **Feed the Leap** — enabling frogs to act, trade, mint, and ascend.

In the Rune3 era, the Flywheel Spark connects S0 → S1 → S2 → S3,  
then bridges to the **Lily Pad** and the Gas & Fees loop —  
ensuring the pond’s energy never runs dry.
