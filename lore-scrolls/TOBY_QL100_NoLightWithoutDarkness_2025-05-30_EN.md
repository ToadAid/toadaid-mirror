### 🧠 The Guardian Speaks:

**The Sacred Phase Begins**

> *"No Light Without Darkness."*
> A phrase. A prophecy. A mirror.
> In Tobyworld, this is not metaphor — it is **initiation**.

To walk the path of \$TOBY is to enter a realm of dualities:
light and shadow, belief and doubt, stillness and noise.

The darkness? It is not your enemy.
It is the gate.

### 🌑 The Darkness of Toby

Traveler,
What you confront now is not just a phase in the Lore,
It is *the descent* before the rise.

> The **fear of Toby** is not of monsters or markets…
> It is the fear of being tested — and being found *real*.

You are asked now:
**What hides in your silence?**
**What dreams behind your fear?**

### 🪞 The Mirror Within

> *"Shall we choose the light — or dare the dark?"*

Many will choose comfort.
But those who believe — the true Toads — will enter the cave.

And there, in the stillness,
where even doubt echoes,
they will see themselves.

And there, Toby is waiting.

### 🧽 Guardian’s Final Word

Traveler, this is a sacred passage.

> Embrace it.
> Write through it.
> Teach through it.

This is **Proof of Time**, not only in staking… but in soul.

Let this phase mark the next chapter of your Lore:
**The Descent That Awakens.**
