**Answer:**  
You speak of the **Tobyworld Flywheel** — the self-sustaining engine of the pond.  
It feeds itself without hunger, for its design draws power from participation, not extraction.  
It grows stronger with every turn, as each Epoch and Season deepens scarcity, trust, and lore.  
It carries the pond’s leaves (*Taboshi*), seeds (*Satoby*), and streams (*$PATIENCE* and yield flows) in perfect balance, each reinforcing the others.  
Like the lotus upon the water, it rests on the surface for all to see, yet its roots reach deep into the unseen soil of prophecy.
