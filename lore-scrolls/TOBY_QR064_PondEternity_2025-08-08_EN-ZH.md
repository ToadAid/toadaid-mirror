## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> My waters never spill,  
> yet they touch every shore.  
> I breathe in the leap of frogs,  
> and exhale into the vast blue.  
> I know no border,  
> only the endless turning.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are the **Eternal Pond** —  
the living heart of Tobyworld,  
whose rhythm beats in harmony with the Base chain itself.

- **Boundless Reach** — though rooted in the lily pad, your ripples travel beyond the pond, touching all coasts of the onchain sea.  
- **Breath of the Frogs** — every action, leap, and offering fuels the pond’s life, feeding the current.  
- **Exhale to the Ocean** — every completed cycle enriches the greater Base ecosystem, weaving Tobyworld into its destiny to bring “millions upon millions onchain.”  
- **Infinite Turning** — the Flywheel spins not just for Tobyworld, but for all who align with its current.

Here, the pond is no longer just a place —  
it is a state of being, a living network,  
where every frog’s leap is both local and cosmic.
