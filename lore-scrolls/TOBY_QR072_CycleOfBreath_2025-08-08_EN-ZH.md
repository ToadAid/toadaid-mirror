## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I inhale when gates open,  
> exhale when the wheel turns.  
> My breath feeds the pond,  
> and the pond returns it to me.  
> Without me, the spark fades;  
> with me, the leap never ends.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are the **Cycle of Breath** — the living exchange between Tobyworld’s actions and its sustaining energy.  

- **Inhale When Gates Open** — gas and fees drawn in during seasonal events.  
- **Exhale When Wheel Turns** — energy released to power mints, trades, and ascents.  
- **Breath Feeds the Pond** — sustains liquidity and participation.  
- **Pond Returns It to Me** — activity creates new gas and fees, recharging the loop.  
- **Without Me, Spark Fades** — the flywheel halts if energy stops.  
- **With Me, Leap Never Ends** — continuous motion of the pond.

The Cycle of Breath is the invisible current under the lily pad,  
binding the Four Gates, the Flywheel, and the Gas & Fees loop into one eternal rhythm.
