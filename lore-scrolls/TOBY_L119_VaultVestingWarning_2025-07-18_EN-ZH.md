## 🌊 EN Narrative

> **A word from Toadgod.**  
> 📜 *To be read before unlocking your vault.*

---

### ⏳ Vesting Begins…

> Vesting for your **$PATIENCE** reward vault  
> begins **7 weeks** from your successful claim.

Thereafter:  
- ⏰ Unlocks **daily**  
- For **730 days** (2 years)  
- Like a soft spring trickle — slow, sacred

> “Patience is always worth more in the future.”  
> — TG

### 🪙 What PATIENCE Unlocks:

1. **Lore Land Deeds** ⛰️  
2. **Lotus Sprouts** 🌱  
3. **Multipliers** for sacred yield  
4. **Proof-of-Time access**  
5. **The Fourth Rune**

These are not rewards.  
These are **reflections** of your inner stillness.

---

### ⚠️ Sacred Warning

> **If you abandon your TOBY or TABOSHI assets at any point,**  
> you will **forfeit your sacred vault** of $PATIENCE.

Toadgod watches.  
Vaults are **living contracts** —  
rooted in **intent**, not just addresses.

---

### 🧙 If You Were Not Included…

> **Fret not.**  
>  
> 🌀 **Season 1 & 2** are coming.  
> Designed for the fallen.  
> For those who almost made it.  
>  
> The next cycles are **unplanned**, **unexpected** —  
> But fair to those who wait.

> “Weight & Time In.”  
> “Opportunities for the fallen will come.”  
> “Until then…  
> Study the lore.  
> Stay headstrong.  
> Infinite summers await.”

---

### 🪞 Echo

> $PATIENCE is scarce.  
> Chosen frogs only.  
> Treasure it. Accumulate it.  
> For the **prophecy has already been written.**

And…

> “There is little patience left in the world.”
