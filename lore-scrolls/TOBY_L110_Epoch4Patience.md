### Seed of Doubt / Seed of Glory

Markets chant the age-old cycle:
**FUD → FOMO → Cope → Euphoria → Repeat**

> Frogs who flip for crumbs end up with cope.
> Millions in \$TOBY were distributed. Many sold. Few survived.

> True wealth? Never loud. It transfers mind-to-mind, not wallet-to-wallet.

> Mirror the mind. Magnetize the world. Keep leaves. Keep \$PATIENCE. Keep Toby.

When the combination aligns, **infinite summers**.

### Call to the Fallen: TWPoT

Your whispers echo.
You mint pixel runes. Spin reels. Carve silence into meaning.
Toadgod sees.

To correct doubters — use **lore or silence**, not rage.

> The Lore prevails. It has already been written. Land awaits.

> \$TOBY: A blue chip bound not by empire, but by prophecy.

The sideline will cry, “Just lucky.”
We respond: “We listened to still water.”

---

### The Weight of the Rune

> Time matters. Epochs matter.
> Leaf + Frog + Patience = Key.

Toadgod rewards the **loyal** and the **fallen**.

> Believe. Patience. Rise. Gambatte.

**T.O.B.Y.W\.O.R.L.D on Base.**
Sooner than you think.

> **Gi 勇 仁 礼 誠 名譽 忠義**: Seven reeds. One pond.

https://basescan.org/tx/0xe79076adaf3163191f3d32179e4cd94996092fc78199d35674d01592538732e9
seed of doubt / seed of glory

markets chant age old chorus:

fud → fomo → cope → euphoria → repeat.

frogs who flip for crumbs, end up with cope. tg distributed millions of $ in toby to the masses, many sold, few survived. only the patient.

price of short‑gain = true log‑wealth missed.  transfer happens silently. internally. mind to mind, not wallet to wallet.

but if one decides with conviction...abandon wall of worry.mental storms melt. mind becomes mirror; mirror becomes magnet.patience becomes easy.

keep leaves. keep patience. keep toby. once tobyworld ascends. for the combination will unlock infinite summers. 

choose seed of doubt, harvest dust. choose seed of glory, harvest gold.
a call to lore: twpot

fallen frogs:  your efforts breathes. you contribute in way unbeknownst to the naked eye to tobyworld.  your words some close. some far. spin reels, carve pixel runes, croak at midnight spaces. tg will find ways to include all extraordinary efforts. tobyworld is for the people.  correct doubters with silence or lore, never rage.  remember: the lore will always prevail. for it has been written. seasons ahead. summers ahead. land owners await. reality is in play. 

$toby a blue chip unlike any other, bound by no empire. only tobyworld.  when the sideline arrive they will muster "just lucky"  bushido frogs will respond "we simply listened to still water."

for the next rune activation, weight and time matter. epochs accumulate. hold leaf. hold frog. hold patience with strength. for toadgod rewards the loyal & fallen.  

believe.  patience.  rise.  gambatte.   

t.o.b.y.w.o.r.l.d on base coming. sooner than you think. 

Gi 勇 仁 礼 誠 名誉 忠義: seven reeds, one pond. without toby nothing will be possible.

for the people.
