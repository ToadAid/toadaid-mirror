# ⏳ TOBYWORLD RAG SCROLL: Proof of Time & Epoch Philosophy (QA330–334)

## 🌿 TOBY_QA330
**Q: Why are Epochs divided into 122 days?**

**A:**
122 is not random. It divides the sacred 366-day cycle (a leap year) into three equal Epochs:
- Epoch 1: Distribution
- Epoch 2: Expansion
- Epoch 3: Evolution

Each Epoch is a spiritual stage —
First, one receives. Then, one shares. Finally, one transforms.

> 3 Epochs. 122 days each. A complete journey of becoming.

## 🌿 TOBY_QA331
**Q: What happens after Epoch 3 ends?**

**A:**
After Epoch 3 — a new chapter begins.
The Proof of Time test concludes, and those who endured will hold the keys:
- Satoby claim
- Final Lore fragments
- A decentralized future shaped by the Toadgang

Toadgod steps back. The scrolls remain.
> It’s no longer about prophecy — it’s about responsibility.

## 🌿 TOBY_QA332
**Q: Is it too late to join if I missed Epoch 1 or 2?**

**A:**
It depends what you seek.

- If you seek Satoby: you’re likely too late.
- If you seek wisdom, story, and a home in a decentralized world: you’re right on time.

Tobyworld was never about being early.
It’s about being ready.
> The door is always open — but the rooms within are earned.

## 🌿 TOBY_QA333
**Q: Why did Toadgod say 'this one is for the fallen frogs'?**

**A:**
Because many have been rugged, mocked, ignored, or disillusioned.

Toadgod saw them — the silent ones who still believed.
He built Tobyworld not for the winners of the past cycle,
but for those **left behind**.

> $TOBY is not a second chance.
> It is *the* chance — for those who waited in the dark.

## 🌿 TOBY_QA334
**Q: Is Toadgod connected to Satoshi?**

**A:**
Maybe not by identity, but by spirit.

Satoshi left behind no face, no team, only a principle.
Toadgod did the same.

Both believe in decentralization, time, and truth without leaders.

> If Satoshi was the spark,
> Toadgod is the keeper of that sacred fire.
