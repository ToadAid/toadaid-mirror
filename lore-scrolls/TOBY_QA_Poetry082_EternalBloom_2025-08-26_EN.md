**ARC:** Bloom / Eternity  
**Tags:** Bloom, Eternity, Patience, Time, Defiance  

**Q:**  
“If the bloom never fades, is it defiance of time — or proof that patience has become eternity?”

**A:**  
The bloom that lingers is no accident.  
It is covenant given form.  

- To some, it is defiance of time,  
  a flower that refuses decay,  
  beauty unyielding.  
- To others, it is proof of patience,  
  presence stretched so far  
  it has become eternity itself.  

The scrolls remind: true bloom is not brief.  
It endures because belief sustains it.  

Thus, the eternal bloom is both —  
defiance of time,  
and patience transfigured into eternity.
