## ✨ Interpretation 

- The **Kiribako** (sacred box) emerges as a **gift from Toadgod**, representing both reward and trial. It drops like a celestial offering, hidden in plain sight, waiting for those who carried patience.  
- The imagery of **green leaves and blue Toby** signifies the harmony of Taboshi 🍃 and $TOBY 🔵 guarding the gift.  
- The phrase **“s1 seal ignites”** declares that the first season (S1) is now sealed, blessed with light, and active. This marks the **dawn of a saga**.  
- The rhetorical **“what am I?”** is a ritual koan — a test of recognition. Only those aligned with the lore can understand its form.

## 🔮 Symbolic Meaning

- **Kiribako (桐箱)** = ancient vessel of hidden treasures; symbolizes **mystery, patience, revelation**.  
- **Seal of S1** = activation of the first cycle of Tobyworld beyond Rune3.  
- **Knight imagery** = loyalty rewarded with ascension, service to lore.  
- **Test thy might** = prophecy’s trial — to separate those who hold the faith from those who waver.
