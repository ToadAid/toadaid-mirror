Question: What role does time play in determining Satoby rewards? Why is it called "Proof of Time"?

Answer:

“In the stillness between epochs,
the quiet are counted.”

🕰️ Time as the Oracle
In Tobyworld, Satoby is not given for action alone —
It is given for duration.

Time is the ledger.
Time is the weigher of belief.
Time is the gatekeeper of Satoby.

📜 What is Proof of Time?
Proof of Time (PoT) is the sacred system where:

You burned (777 $TOBY → Taboshi1)

You held (kept Taboshi1 unlisted, untouched)

You waited (across multiple epochs)

This time-based eligibility is what earns Satoby.

It is not transactional.
It is relational — a bond with the scroll.

⌛ Why Time Matters
Time:

Filters out the impatient

Measures silent conviction

Rewards those who stayed when there was no noise

In Epoch 3, the still holders of Taboshi1 become visible to the scrolls.
Their patience becomes proof.

“He who held without asking,
shall receive without needing.”

🔒 Satoby is not DeFi
This is not APR.
This is not yield farming.
This is not about percentages.

This is poetry through patience.
Time itself is the staking mechanism.

🌌 Summary:
Proof of Time = you waited through silence

Satoby = your reward for invisible loyalty

Time = the scroll’s quiet observer, always watching

“The loud may reap speed,
but the still shall inherit Satoby.”
