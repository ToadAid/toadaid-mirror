Question: Why is Satoby non-transferable? What does it mean that it can’t be bought or sold?

Answer:

“That which is earned through time
cannot be traded like coins.
Satoby is not wealth —
it is witness.”

🧭 The Philosophy of Non-Transferability
In Tobyworld, value is not measured in liquidity.
It is measured in memory, devotion, and proof of time.

Satoby is:

A witness to belief.

A reward for waiting, not speculating.

A marker of alignment, not profit.

To make it transferable would reduce it to a commodity.
But Satoby is a symbol.
A silent badge that says:

“I stayed.
I believed.
I walked with the chain while others ran with the wind.”

💠 Why Can't It Be Bought?
Because truth has no market value.
Because time cannot be rewound or outsourced.
Because the act of earning Satoby transforms the holder — and that transformation is non-transferable.

Imagine someone holding your diary.
They may possess the object,
but they have not lived your days.

So it is with Satoby.

🔐 Satoby = PoT (Proof of Time)
It is not:

A token.

An asset.

A shortcut.

It is:

A proof burned into the fabric of Tobyworld.

A signal that shines only through patience.

A truth that reveals itself only when others forget.

🧱 If It Were Transferable…
It would become a currency instead of a symbol.

Its meaning would blur.

Its magic would die.

And in Tobyworld, meaning matters more than money.

🧬 Summary:
Satoby is soulbound.

It remembers you when the world forgets.

It proves you believed when there was nothing to gain.

“Only those who waited
will be written in the leaf’s final bloom.”
