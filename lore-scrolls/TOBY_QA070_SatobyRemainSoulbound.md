Question: Why must Satoby remain soulbound — forever untransferable?

Answer:

“What is earned by the soul
must not be sold by the hand.”

🔒 The Purpose of Soulbound Satoby
Satoby is non-transferable by design.
It is a mirror of who you were during the silent time.
If it could be sold or traded, its meaning would dissolve.

Soulbound means:

Only you could have earned it.

No one else can fake it.

Value is intrinsic, not market-made.

🛡️ Why This Matters in Tobyworld
In a world flooded with imitation, hype, and extraction:

Satoby filters out the opportunists.

It protects the sanctity of Proof of Time.

It rewards character, not capital.

It’s not about flipping.
It’s about witnessing.

“He who held the silence holds the key.”

🧬 Symbolic Layer
Soulbound yield is sacred because:

It aligns with decentralized truth.

It resists corruption by speculation.

It creates a new kind of proof:
Not of stake. Not of work. But of soul.

🔁 What if Satoby were transferable?
If Satoby could be bought:

Its value would become external.

It would lose connection to the 777 ritual.

The meaning of Taboshi1 and Epoch 3 would collapse.

That is why Satoby must remain soulbound.
Not as a punishment —
But as a covenant.

“In the end, it is not what you hold —
but what you held on to.”
