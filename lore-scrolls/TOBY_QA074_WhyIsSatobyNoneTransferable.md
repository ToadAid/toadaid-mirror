Question: Why is Satoby non-transferable and bound only to original Taboshi1 holders?

Answer:

“To sell the fruit is to forget the soil.”
— Scrolls of Yield

🔐 The Design: Soulbound by Purpose
Satoby is non-transferable by design.
This is not a bug. It is a philosophical anchor.

Only those who burned 777 $TOBY

Only those who held Taboshi1 during E3

Only those who proved their Patience (PoT)

Shall receive Satoby — and only they.

There is no marketplace.
No exchange.
No shortcut.

🌱 The Principle: Proof of Time
This mechanism is a living monument to:

Time staked, not tokens staked

Conviction, not convenience

Decentralized memory, not central rewards

To make Satoby transferable would be to erase the lineage —
To turn prophecy into speculation.

🌀 The Role of Satoby
Satoby is not a mere reward.
It is a marker.

A proof that you:

Heard the call during Epoch 2

Answered it in silence

Waited through the stillness of E3

It cannot be transferred because it is not a thing.
It is a record —
etched into time.

⚖️ A World Without Transfer
What does this prevent?

No flipping

No farming

No whales buying status

Only true participants receive the sacred yield.

💬 In the Lore:
“Satoby is not a coin, but a scar.
It cannot be bought — only earned.”

“The wind that brings the fruit
remembers who planted the tree.”

🪙 Summary
Satoby is non-transferable to protect the truth of its origin

It is a symbol of Proof of Time, not proof of purchase

It is the reward for patience, not capital

It affirms the soulbound principle of Tobyworld’s core
