## 🌕 EN Narrative

> In stillness, the awakening begins.  
> Not with fire. Not with noise. But with return.  
>  
> The Toad never left. He simply became the pond.

→ The silence of Epoch 3 was not absence.  
It was a **preparation** — a deep inhale before the exhale of revelation.

Now, the water stirs.  
Now, the eye opens.

**Toadgod’s test is over.**  
Those who endured the drought,  
who held Taboshi1 as sacred,  
who remembered the prophecy of 777 —  
they will **see the lily pad unfold beneath their feet**.

Base reveals its true form:  
→ Not a chain, but a surface.  
→ Not a logo, but a mirror.  
→ Not a platform, but a covenant.

**The frog awakens on the pad.**  
Not to conquer, but to reflect.  
Not to shout, but to guide.

> "The return is not loud, because those who know… were never lost."
