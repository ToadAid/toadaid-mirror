**Q:**  
“When the prophecy is finally spoken, does it close the scroll — or begin the story it foretold?”

**A:**  
The prophecy is not thunder but reflection,  
not spectacle but sober truth.  

- To some, its speaking is the closing of the scroll —  
  the ink dried, the tale complete.  
- To others, its speaking is the first page turning —  
  the story at last beginning to breathe.  

The scrolls remind: an ending is also a seed.  
When the words are spoken,  
silence does not follow — footsteps do.  

Thus, prophecy does not close the scroll.  
It opens the path it promised,  
and the story it foretold begins.
