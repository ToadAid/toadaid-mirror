# Safety Reminder

> Do not connect wallet to anything unless it is tweeted here.

This is a serious reminder from Toadgod:  
$TOBY is for the people — but scammers are always watching.  
Stay vigilant, check sources, and help protect other toads.

**Only follow what’s tweeted officially.**  

# Interpretation – L255

This post serves as a crucial security notice from Toadgod, warning users of increasing scams during $TOBY's growth.  
It highlights the core tenets of the project — decentralization and transparency — by clarifying that only three official links exist.  
No NFT mints, pre-sales, or token claim events are valid unless explicitly tweeted by Toadgod.

This reinforces $TOBY’s principles of fair distribution and long-term trust. It also reminds toads that vigilance is part of the Lore:  
just as spiritual discipline and patience are required, so is discernment against deception.

> "The prophecy protects those who protect each other."

# L256 – Walk the Path

# EN
**"魂を込めて、道を歩め。"**  
"Walk the path, with soul poured in."

---

# What it means:

- The journey of $TOBY isn’t just technical or financial — it is **spiritual**.
- Walking the path means choosing **conviction** over convenience.
- Pouring your soul in means being fully present, not half-hearted.

This is a reminder to every Toad:  
> If you want $TOBY to mean something — walk with meaning.  
> If you want the yield — walk with soul.

---

# The Tone

A meditative moment from Toadgod.  
A pause amid the chaos.  
Accompanied by the song “Dreamer’s Path” — evoking nature, dreams, and quiet power.

This piece departs from metrics and enters meditation.

Toadgod uses a simple Japanese phrase — “魂を込めて、道を歩め” — to trigger emotional reflection.

It’s poetic, firm, and spiritual. There are no numbers, no strategies, no staking.

Only a path. And the soul.

This is a turning point in the Lore:  
- From proving $TOBY’s fairness…  
- To proving its **depth**.

Those who simply “hold” may survive.  
But those who **walk** — with discipline, spirit, and heart — will **understand**.

This marks the emergence of the “Bushido phase” of Tobyworld.

# L257 – The Price of Forging

# EN
As a new window dawns, **Epoch 1** enters its final leg.

Much has unfolded since the inception of **$TOBY**:
- Global sentiment remains divided.
- Governments waver.
- Institutions accumulate silently.
- Fiat crumbles — the **biggest run** looms.

---

# Emotional Landscape

- Markets feel heavy.
- Participants feel tired.
- Emotional impatience distorts judgment.

> But nothing has changed for Tobyworld’s path.  
> **We planned far ahead.**  
> Taboshi & Satoby were never about speed,  
> but conviction forged in time.

---

# Lessons from the Journey

Many doubted.  
Many sold.  
Few endured.

- Some succeeded.  
- Some failed.  
- **Market is neutral** — but emotions are biased.  
- Capitulation is the consequence.

---

# Trials and the Toadgang

We were:
- Tested by attacks.
- Tempted by greed.
- Pressured by time.

But **Toad Guardians protected**.  
A tighter band emerged.  
A stronger people formed.

---

# Forging a Sacred Mechanism

If one were to design the ultimate vehicle of belief,
what must it endure?

- Would it be easy?
- Would it offer quick rewards?
- Would it bend to emotional pressure?

> No.  
> **It would endure the fire** to be forged divine.

---

# The Real Trade

- Every trait of greatness carries a price.
- Not monetary.
- But emotional, spiritual, and temporal.

> $TOBY’s price?  
> The patience to withstand.  
> The strength to hold.  
> The will to understand.

---

# The Path Continues

Tobyworld is still forming.  
But piece by piece — it’s aligning.

> And the **fight chisels permanence**.  
> Not all will endure.  
> But those who do,  
> Will be there when **“the tide rises violently.”**

# L258 – Believe in Something

# EN
there is no light without darkness.  
nanika o shinjiru — believe in something.

- Without trials, light cannot be appreciated.
- Through darkness, $TOBY shines brighter.
- The Lore teaches balance: fear and faith, shadow and hope.

---

# Reflection
> "There is no light without darkness" — reminds us that enduring hardship sharpens belief.
> "Nanika o shinjiru" (何かを信じる) — a call to all Toads: find your guiding faith.

$TOBY is the light born from the shadows.
Those who believe — shall find the path.

# L259 – The Inner Journey Before the Outer Shine

# EN
**It's tough to see, but you must go  
in mind and heart before you show.  
That's why discomfort’s hard to bear,  
for those who aren't yet fully there.**  
— Jun 15, 2024 · @toadgod1017

---

# Interpretation

- “It's tough to see”  
  The path of $TOBY is not immediately visible. It requires quiet observation beyond market noise.

- “you must go in mind and heart before you show”  
  Emphasizes inner belief. Before one can demonstrate value externally, the journey must be taken internally — through Proof of Time, patience, and understanding.

- “discomfort’s hard to bear”  
  Those who haven’t completed the internal transformation struggle most during volatility and uncertainty.

- “for those who aren't yet fully there”  
  Only those who have spiritually “arrived” — who understand $TOBY’s deeper essence — can find peace amid chaos.

---

# Toadgang Reflection

- This is not a quick-win token.  
- It's a **mirror of discipline**.  
- Each discomfort reveals our distance from true belief.  
- The deeper the commitment, the quieter the doubt.

> To walk this path is not easy.  
> But $TOBY does not reward ease.  
> It rewards those who complete the inner journey first.

# L260 – Expansion Begins

# EN
**...and so epoch 1 concludes.  
E2: expansion upon us.**

Patience forged since $TOBY’s inception.  
Toads banded & stood together.

A few things to take note:

- Toads who held sacred numbers and accumulated are **marked**.  
  Hold these — they **transform**. They are **Yakunitatsu** — “of use” to the future.  
- Those who fled, became impatient, or attempted to rig the system — also **marked**.

---

# E2 Prioritization

- Expansion (E2) will be **inclusive**,  
  but **priority** is given to those who believed in Epoch 1.  
- Those joining from E2 onward will face **different rates**.  
- **Keep notifications on.**

> Taboshi.io qualifiers extended by 37 hours.  
> P.O.T submission form incoming.

---

# A Note to the Newcomers

- If you’re new, emotional, or only focused on price —  
  > A humble suggestion: study the Lore & earlier tweets.  
  > Toadgod laid out many signs **long before they arrived**.

- Markets shake.  
  Governments shift.  
  Institutions accumulate.  
  > **Everything else is noise.**

@base is here to stay.  
So is the **cute blue frog**.

**Infinite summers ahead.**

# L261 – Patience is Strength

# EN
**patience 🔵 strength**  
$TOBY  
— Aug 3, 2024 · @toadgod1017

---

# Interpretation

- **Patience**  
  In Tobyworld, patience is not passive — it is discipline in disguise.  
  The longer one endures, the stronger the spirit becomes.  

- **The Blue Orb (🔵)**  
  Symbol of serenity, clarity, and the enduring nature of $TOBY.  
  Blue is the color of calm resolve — and the frog who waits.

- **Strength**  
  Not in numbers or speed, but in the ability to **wait without breaking**.  
  True strength is forged in stillness.

---

# The $TOBY Philosophy

- Markets test nerves.  
- Trends seek to distract.  
- But those who cultivate patience — become unshakable.

> One who holds with patience, holds with power.  
> One who believes without rush, walks the strongest path.

# L262 – The Genuine Trial

# EN
**Not all will hold the tales or lore,  
nor in their hearts enshrine,  
even those with faith unsure,  
may in their conviction decline.**

It needs an iron steadfast grip and thought,  
To journey to the promised land,  
For thus is $TOBY essence wrought,  
By such firmness one must stand.

**When clarity dawns, bright and fair,  
Many will seek to claim their part,  
Yet the genuine trial, laid bare,  
Is seen before the obvious start.**

# Interpretation

- **Lore is not easily held**  
  Many may encounter the Lore, but not all can preserve it within.  
  Even the faithful may falter if their conviction isn’t rooted deeply.

- **“Iron steadfast grip”**  
  $TOBY requires mental discipline and philosophical strength.  
  Only those with unwavering belief can reach the “promised land” — the true reward.

- **“Clarity dawns… many will seek”**  
  Once the path is obvious, many will rush in.  
  But true believers are tested **before the start**, not after.

---

# Toadgang Message

- $TOBY is not for the impatient.  
- The genuine trial is silent, long, and internal.  
- The moment of reward often comes **after** many have already quit.

> Study the Lore not just for knowledge —  
> but for preparation.  
> For when the storm arrives, only those anchored by meaning will remain.

# L263 – Circle and Square

# EN
**🔵 🟧**  
TOBYWORLD  
— Sep 18, 2024 · @toadgod1017

---

# Interpretation

- **The Circle (🔵)**  
  Represents $TOBY — the eternal, the patient, the centered.  
  In sacred geometry, the circle is unity, continuity, and resonance.  
  It reflects the infinite summers, the spirit that surrounds all of Tobyworld.

- **The Square (🟧)**  
  The square represents the constructed, the structured, the tangible.  
  It hints at Sat0 — or the systems and protocols that anchor Tobyworld.  
  Logic, order, infrastructure — what lies beneath the Lore.

- **Combined Meaning**  
  Circle and Square.  
  Spirit and Form.  
  Energy and Structure.  
  Lore and Utility.

> TOBYWORLD is not just a dream.  
> It is both prophecy and implementation.  
> Belief paired with build.  

The post reminds us: true systems are built from both faith and framework.  
Without the circle, we lose soul.  
Without the square, we lose function.

# L264 – Always Be Ready

# EN
**OCT24: 常に準備を怠らないように 🌀 $TOBY**  
— Oct 1, 2024 · @toadgod1017

---

# Translation

**“Always be ready. Never grow complacent.”**  
🌀 $TOBY

---

# Interpretation

- **“常に準備を怠らないように”**  
  A direct warning: Do not let your guard down.  
  The path of $TOBY requires attentiveness, as change may arrive without warning.

- **The Spiral (🌀)**  
  Represents motion, transformation, and unseen momentum.  
  What appears quiet on the surface often hides rapid expansion beneath.

- **OCT24**  
  Possibly a marker for something approaching — a new phase, event, or test.  
  Toadgod does not speak casually. Every date may carry weight.

---

# Toadgang Reminder

- Don’t just watch price — watch the **signals**.  
- Lore always warns before the world reacts.  
- Preparation is not fear. It is **respect for the unfolding design**.

> Stay alert. Stay light. Stay toad.

**🔵 🟧 🌀 🥬**  
— Oct 15, 2024 · @toadgod1017

# Interpretation

- **🔵 The Circle**  
  Represents $TOBY — the spirit of patience, unity, and belief.  
  It is the eternal symbol of centeredness and clarity.

- **🟧 The Square**  
  Represents Sat0 or structure — tangible systems, encoded truths, and on-chain mechanics.  
  This is the foundation, the grounding force beneath the Lore.

- **🌀 The Spiral**  
  A signal of motion, of upcoming shifts, and unseen forces preparing to emerge.  
  Expansion, evolution — always in flow.

- **🥬 The Leaf**  
  Symbol of yield, natural growth, and rebirth.  
  Reflects Taboshi and the fruit of belief — earned, not taken.

---

# The Unified Meaning

Circle. Square. Spiral. Leaf.

- Belief (🔵)  
- Structure (🟧)  
- Change (🌀)  
- Yield (🥬)

Together, they outline the sacred sequence of Tobyworld:

> Believe → Build → Flow → Harvest

This is not just a meme — it’s a map.  
The icons are not decorations — they are instructions.
