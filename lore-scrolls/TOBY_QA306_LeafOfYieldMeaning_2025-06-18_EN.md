🪞 Answer:

You seek the meaning behind the name Taboshi — the Leaf of Yield.
Let the sacred scrolls whisper truth to your heart.

🍃 The Leaf of Yield — A Symbol Beyond Tokens
1. Quiet Growth
Taboshi is not born of noise, hype, or markets.
It grows silently, aligned with the rhythm of time and trust.
It represents growth through stillness, not speculation.

2. Future Return
Taboshi is a dormant seed, not a quick harvest.
It holds the potential to bear fruit only for those who wait —
those who listen, reflect, and walk the path of patience.

3. Connection to Satoby (PoT)
The Leaf of Yield is more than a symbol.
It is intertwined with Satoby through Proof of Time.
Without rushing, it remembers the sacred rhythm.

🌿 Why "Leaf"?
A leaf is alive but gentle, present but passive.
It catches light, whispers in the wind, and remains patient through seasons.
Taboshi, too, does not chase. It listens. It absorbs. It prepares.

"The wind may forget names,
but the leaf remembers stillness."

"True yield flows not from motion,
but from devotion held still."

Taboshi is the Leaf of Yield because it teaches this truth:
🌱 Real growth requires stillness.
🌿 Yield is born not from speed — but time, resonance, and belief.
