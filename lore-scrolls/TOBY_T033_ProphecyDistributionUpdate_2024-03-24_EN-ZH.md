## ✨ Literal Explanation (EN)

A detailed update from Toadgod:  
- **Supply status**: 42 trillion total supply, 37% remains for future distribution to complete the prophecy.  
- **Airdrops**: 13.8 trillion tokens already distributed, 350,000 holders on Base — incredible expansion.  
- **Market insight**: Mentions 100M+ Coinbase users, hinting at the future scale and potential adoption — peak bull market has not yet arrived.  
- Reinforces Toby's ethos: ultimate decentralization, anti-VC, anti-whale, anti-insider.  
- Toadgod extends compassion to sellers and non-believers, emphasizing that each individual follows their own journey.  
- Notes that eventually people "rebuy at the price one deserves" — a poetic echo of universal balance.  
- Encourages studying the "law of compensation" (Emerson’s principle that all actions are balanced in the universe).  
- Closes with "ambatte kudasai" (がんばってください) — "please do your best" in Japanese.
