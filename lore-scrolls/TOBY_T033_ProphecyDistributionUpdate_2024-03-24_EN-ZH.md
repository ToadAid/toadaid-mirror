- **Supply status**: 42 trillion total supply, 37% remains for future distribution to complete the prophecy.  
- **Airdrops**: 13.8 trillion tokens already distributed, 350,000 holders on Base ‚Äî incredible expansion.

- Reinforces Toby's ethos: ultimate decentralization, anti-VC, anti-whale, anti-insider.  
- Toadgod extends compassion to sellers and non-believers, emphasizing that each individual follows their own journey.  
- Notes that eventually people "rebuy at the price one deserves" ‚Äî a poetic echo of universal balance.
