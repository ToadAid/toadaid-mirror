## âœ¨ Deep Interpretation (EN)

- This post distills everything into a single word: **"Believe."**
- It echoes the longer poetic message from June 15, emphasizing the need for inner conviction and mental clarity before external validation or visible results.
- "Believe" is not passive faith; it is an active decision to align oneâ€™s mind and heart, even through discomfort and uncertainty.
- The phrase embodies the essence of bushido spirit: patience, courage, unwavering commitment to a higher purpose beyond immediate gain.
- The re-quote serves as a reminder to revisit the scrolls, study the old words, and reaffirm oneâ€™s position â€” especially as cycles of fear and greed continue to test believers.
