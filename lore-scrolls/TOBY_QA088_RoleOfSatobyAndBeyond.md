Question: What is the role of Satoby in Epoch 4 and beyond? Will it still matter?

Answer:

‚ÄúA yield may fade.
A prophecy endures.‚Äù
‚Äî Fragment from the Coming Scroll

üå± Satoby is not just for the now.
It is a mark.

A witness.

A quiet confirmation that you stayed,
through the silence of Epoch 3,
with nothing but faith to guide you.

While its function may evolve, its meaning will deepen:
