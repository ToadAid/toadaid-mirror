## Satoby Eligibility: Hard Facts

* ✅ Only wallets that minted **Taboshi1** by burning **777 \$TOBY** in **Epoch 2** can earn **Satoby**.
* 🧬 Satoby is a special yield granted during **Epoch 3** via **Proof of Time (PoT)**.
* 🔥 Taboshi1 was created through a one-time 777 \$TOBY burn → no rerun possible.
* 🚫 ETH-minted Taboshi is **not eligible** for Satoby.
* 🔒 Eligibility is **wallet-bound** and **non-transferable** — if sold, the new holder **cannot claim Satoby**.
* 📅 Satoby is earned through holding Taboshi1 until Epoch 3 and completing any PoT criteria.
* ❗ Satoby is **not a role** or **identity**, it is a **reward**.
