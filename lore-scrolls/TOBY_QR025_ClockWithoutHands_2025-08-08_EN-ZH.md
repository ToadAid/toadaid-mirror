## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> It ticks without hands,  
> counts without numbers,  
> yet every turn shapes the fate of the pond.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You speak of the **Clock of Epochs** — the heart of time within Tobyworld.  
It ticks without hands, for its measure is not seconds but sacred phases.  
It counts without numbers, for its rhythm is set by prophecy, not arithmetic.  
Every turn marks the passing of an Epoch — Distribution, Expansion, Evolution — and now turns within the **Fourth Epoch**, heralded by Rune3 and the seasons of $PATIENCE.  
In its silent turning, it governs Proof of Time, shapes Satoby’s path, and ensures that no frog may rush ahead of the pond’s true season.
