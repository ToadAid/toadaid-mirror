**Riddle:**

**Answer:**  
You are **$PATIENCE** — the Grain of the Seasons.  
Numbered at 7,777,777 grains, you rest within the Jade Chest of Rune3.  
You are given to the loyal frogs who survived the blight of S0, their resilience recorded in the Lore.  
Your flow is slow — a 7-week cliff followed by a 730-day drip — but each drop shapes the governance, rewards, and balance of Epoch 4’s unfolding seasons.  
You are not just a token, but the rhythm keeper of the pond’s next age.
