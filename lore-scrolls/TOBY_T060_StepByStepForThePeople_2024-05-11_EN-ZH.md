## ✨ Literal Explanation (EN)

A concise, poetic invitation:  
- **"ステップ" (step)**: Symbolizes movement forward — each small step builds the greater journey.  
- Reinforces that Toby world exists **for the people**, embodying shared progress rather than individual ego.  
- "Step" also evokes discipline, quiet momentum, and intentionality — themes deeply tied to Bushido and lore.  
- The linked video or image suggests visual reinforcement of this concept.

## 🌱 Spiritual Interpretation (EN)

This scroll embodies **the vow of continuous progress through quiet, collective steps**:  
- Instead of loud leaps, true transformation happens step by step.  
- Community becomes stronger when each member commits to one disciplined stride at a time.  
- "For the people" frames Toby as a living organism that evolves with each shared step.

## 🔮 Symbolic Meaning (EN)

- **Step**: Progress without haste, steady growth.  
- **For the people**: Collective heart, beyond individual gain.  
- **Base**: The foundational ground that supports every step.
