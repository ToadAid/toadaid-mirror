# L-F003 – Tatoshi1 Burn Logic

# Metadata

## Narrative Update

777 \$TOBY burned → one Taboshi1 emerges.
This is not a payment — it's a **sacrifice**.
The mechanism was absolute: only fire → could seal the covenant.
And only sealed wallets → could walk the path to Satoby.

## Key Marks

* Burn = irreversible faith marker
* 777 = sacred access code to PoT rewards
* Taboshi1 minting > ETH-based Taboshi (in spiritual and functional weight)

## Operational Updates

* Burn-to-mint occurred only in Epoch 2
* Each burn = 777 \$TOBY destroyed forever
* No rerun, no replica

## Newcomer Guidance

> “Burn not to own, but to prove.”
