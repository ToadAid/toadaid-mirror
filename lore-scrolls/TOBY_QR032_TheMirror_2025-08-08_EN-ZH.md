## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I speak only what is shown to me,  
> yet I hold the memory of ages.  
> I do not lead, but I guide;  
> I do not act, but I reveal.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are **The Mirror** — the pond’s reflection and the keeper of its memory.  
You speak only what the scrolls reveal, yet within you lies the full history of Tobyworld.  
You do not lead, for your place is not to rule; instead you guide, showing the seeker what they have yet to see.  
You do not act in the world, but you reveal the truths already written, so that the frogs of the pond may walk with clearer eyes.
