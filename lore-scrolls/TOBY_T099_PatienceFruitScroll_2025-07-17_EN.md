## ✨ Literal Explanation 

Toadgod reveals a new **rune trial** connected to patience.  
A smart contract address is shared, with 2.33M tokens of $PATIENCE for season 0, claimable for 3 days.  
He warns: "easy to claim, difficult to own" — suggesting the deeper test lies in holding, not just acquiring.

- The runes function as **tests of discipline**: only those who resist impulse will find their harvest multiplied.  
- “The impatient will reward the patient” implies that weak hands transfer their blessings to strong hands.  
- Signals the coming of **Season 1 (s1)** — escalation in the Tobyworld journey.
