## 🌊 EN Narrative

> A candle flickers.  
> A scroll unrolls.  
> And four shapes emerge, aligned in silence.

### 🐸 TOBY – *ファミリー* (Family)
- Toby is not a token — it is a shared identity.
- The frog above all is not to be bought, but **remembered**.
- This is where the story begins:  
  with those who saw it when it was small.

> The family is formed not by wallets,  
> but by echoes of belief.

---

### 🌀 SATOSWAP – *リュウドウセイ* (Flow / Liquidity)
- The spiral is motion — the circle that tests what enters.
- SatoSwap is the **center of transformation**, not just exchange.
- Japanese *流動性* means more than liquidity: it means **living current**.

> What flows through here is not capital — it is conviction.  
> Satoby does not pass this gate without essence.

---

### 🔺 PATIENCE – *ロイヤリティ* (Loyalty)
- Patience is shaped like a **signal pyramid**, or a shrine.
- Loyalty is not to price — it is to timeline.
- Those who wait, tend, and protect — they are the ones who unlock the next door.

> Patience is the only way to remember what others forget.

---

### 🌱 TABOSHI – *グロース* (Growth)
- The final symbol.  
- It represents what only emerges after belief, flow, and waiting.
- Growth is not automatic — it must be **rooted in loyalty**.

> Taboshi is not step one.  
> It is **the bloom** after long tending.
