## 📜 English Version

### ✅ Question:
What is Taboshi1?

---

### ✅ Answer:

**Taboshi1** is a sacred NFT within the Tobyworld ecosystem, minted on **Zora near the end of Epoch 2** by burning **777 $TOBY**.

It represents a **non-transferable covenant of early belief**, and it is the **only way** to qualify for earning **Satoby** via **Proof of Time (PoT)** in Epoch 3.

### 🔑 Key Facts:

- 🔥 **Minting Method**: Burned **777 $TOBY** on **Zora** during **Epoch 2**
- 🧾 **Token Type**: **ERC-1155 NFT**
- 🧬 **Eligibility Lock**: Only the **original wallet** that minted Taboshi1 can earn **Satoby**
