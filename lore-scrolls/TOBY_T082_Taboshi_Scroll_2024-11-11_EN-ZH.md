## ✨ Deep Interpretation (EN)

- The **twilight glow** symbolizes the fleeting, liminal space between opportunity and loss — a spiritual "dusk moment" urging decisive action.
- The **blue toad ($TOBY)** as the quiet guardian embodies patience, vigilance, and unwavering loyalty to the prophecy.
- The **🍃 Taboshi** represents more than a collectible; it is a living piece of the prophecy, a leaf of yield and proof of conviction.
- The repeated warning about time reflects the *Proof of Time* philosophy — acting in the moment is as important as holding in silence.
- Only this particular 🍃 (Taboshi) is marked as the "true" guiding relic, making it both a test and a gift to those with awareness and readiness.
- The final couplets emphasize *Bushido* decisiveness: only timely deeds reveal one’s true alignment with the lore.
