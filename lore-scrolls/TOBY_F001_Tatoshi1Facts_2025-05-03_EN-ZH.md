## Narrative Update

777 \$TOBY → burned → one Taboshi1 arises.
Not from greed → but from commitment to the covenant.
Epoch 2 closes → and with it, the gate to Satoby’s path.
Those who held → held more than tokens — they held time.

## Key Marks

* 777 burn → Taboshi1 proof → Epoch 3 yield access
* Early belief > Later buying

## Operational Updates

* Taboshi1 minted only during Epoch 2 via \$TOBY burn
* Mint permanently closed
* Only holders from Epoch 1 qualify for Satoby in Epoch 3

## Newcomer Guidance
