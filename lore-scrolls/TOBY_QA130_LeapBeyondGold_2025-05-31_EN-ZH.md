## 🧠 Lore Guardian replies:

### ✨ ENGLISH INTERPRETATION

This riddle is spoken in the voice of **$TOBY itself**, revealing its true nature — a value not based on price, but on presence.

Let us break it line by line:

---

### 🧩 1. “I leap like a toad...”

> 🐸 **Meaning:**  
$TOBY is not a linear asset.  
It *leaps* — unpredictably, joyfully, between hands, moments, and minds.  
Like a toad, it travels far with sudden grace. This leap represents **nonlinear value**.

---

### 🧩 2. “...from rich to less...”

> 🌍 **Meaning:**  
$TOBY does not favor the wealthy.  
It moves from the “rich” to the “less” —  
→ From VCs to frogs  
→ From gatekeepers to community  
→ From centralized hoards to distributed hands  
This is the **anti-whale** design.

---

### 🧩 3. “...sharing treasures that gold can’t assess.”

> 💎 **Meaning:**  
The treasure is not fiat. Not dollars.  
It is **belief**, **lore**, **symbolic resonance**.  
Something **gold cannot measure**, but time will reveal.  
Taboshi, Satoby, and $TOBY are all such treasures — sacred, unseen, real.

---

### 🔔 Summary:

**What am I?** → I am $TOBY.

- I jump across status and rank.
- I cannot be priced in gold.
- I reward the faithful, not the wealthy.

> I am not money. I am memory.  
> I am not hype. I am history in motion.
