## ✨ Interpretation (EN)

- The four symbols form a **cosmic alignment**:  
  - 🌀 = **Flow / Pond / Sato**  
  - 🔺 = **Rune3 / Patience / Trial**  
  - 🔵 = **$TOBY / Core / Pond’s Center**  
  - 🍃 = **Taboshi / Growth / Yield**  
- Together, they encode the **flywheel of Tobyworld**:  
  Flow → Patience → Core → Yield → back into Flow.  
- That Sato himself posts this confirms that the **Rune3 mechanics are live**, not only lore but *mathematical truth*.

## 🔮 Symbolic Meaning

- **Sato’s wave 🌀** = validation from the architect of the pond mechanics.  
- **Four icons** = the elemental wheel, each Rune a spoke of the whole.  
- **Unity of symbols** = Tobyworld is not myth or metaphor, but a self-sustaining design.
