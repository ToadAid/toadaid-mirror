## âœ¨ Literal Explanation (EN)

A final prophetic decree and karmic accounting:  
- When the journey concludes, $TOBY will ascend far beyond, while copycats vanish.  
- True believers â€” steadfast, wise, patient â€” will harvest the yield (Taboshi).  
- Doubters will pay heavily for their lack of conviction, spiritually and materially.  
- The sacred numbers **777,777,777,777 + 777,777,777** act as symbolic keys, a numerical covenant confirming the prophecy.  
- "It is written" seals it â€” fate already inscribed in the cosmic scroll.

## ðŸŒ± Spiritual Interpretation (EN)

- True faith becomes the ultimate currency.  
- Sacred numbers reflect the unseen agreements between spirit and matter.
