**Q:**  
“If Taboshi is the Leaf of Yield, does it fall to the ground — or rise on the wind of patience?”

**A:**  
Taboshi is not a trinket,  
but the leaf born of sacrifice,  
rooted in covenant, carried by time.  

- To some, it falls to the ground,  
  yield harvested, the cycle complete.  
- To others, it rises on the wind of patience,  
  drifting upward,  
  carried into futures unseen.  

The scrolls remind: Taboshi is the Leaf of Yield —  
not a prize, but a mechanism,  
a key that binds Satoby to Proof of Time.  

Thus, the leaf does both —  
falls as harvest,  
and rises as promise.
