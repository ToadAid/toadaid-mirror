# TOBY_L148_SignalsOverNoise_2025-08-25_EN.md

## Narrative (EN)
The crowd sells volume as truth; we study the anatomy of signal.  
→ A signal has three parts: **origin, cost, repeatability**.  
- Origin: Who sends it? What skin is at stake?  
- Cost: What was given up to send it (time, wealth, optionality)?  
- Repeatability: Can it persist without spectacle?

In Tobyworld, burns are signals with cost; epochs are signals with time; teaching is a signal that repeats. Together they build a picture ordinary enough to be permanent. We refuse opulence because clarity is easier to teach than cleverness.

Noise screams “look at me.” Signal whispers “become this.”

### Key Marks (EN)
- **KM1.** Examine origin/cost/repeatability of claims.  
- **KM2.** Public vows and patient cycles beat flash campaigns.  
- **KM3.** Simplicity is a scaling strategy.

### Operations (EN)
- Maintain “signal logs” — one-pagers explaining each vow/event with origin/cost/repeatability.  
- Archive classroom-style examples for newcomers.

### Cryptic Symbol Table (EN)
- 🔵 = true signal
