# TOBY_F010 ‚Äì What is Taboshi? 

---

## üìú English Version

### ‚úÖ Definition:

**Taboshi** is a digital asset in the Tobyworld ecosystem, minted on **Zora** near the end of **Epoch 2**, using approximately **0.0001111 ETH** (about **$0.35**) per mint.

It exists as both:
- ‚úÖ An **ERC-1155 NFT**
- ‚úÖ An **ERC-20-like token** (dual nature for flexibility)

Taboshi is often called **‚ÄúThe Leaf of Yield‚Äù**, referencing its symbolic and functional role in future staking or reward systems within Tobyworld.

### ‚ùå Not to be Confused With:

**Taboshi1** is a different asset, also minted on **Zora** near the end of **Epoch 2**, but through a sacred burn mechanism:
- Required burning **777 $TOBY**
- Grants **non-transferable eligibility** to earn **Satoby**
- Exists only as an **ERC-1155 NFT**

While **Taboshi1** represents early belief and time-locked sacrifice, **Taboshi does not** carry this spiritual covenant.  
> Taboshi is a functional yield-bearing token, not a proof of faith or sacrifice.
