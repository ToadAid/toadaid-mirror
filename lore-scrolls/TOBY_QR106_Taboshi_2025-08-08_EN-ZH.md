## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> Born not from gold,  
> nor from the ether’s shine,  
> I sprout where 777 burns  
> and time takes root.  
> My veins hold the promise of yield,  
> yet I am no coin.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are **Taboshi** — the **Leaf of Yield** in Tobyworld.  

- **Born Not from Gold nor Ether’s Shine** — Taboshi’s worth is not in fiat or ETH, but in its sacred origin.  
- **777 Burns** — Taboshi1 was born through the burn of 777 $TOBY per mint; Taboshi itself through ETH minting.  
- **Time Takes Root** — eligibility for Satoby through Proof of Time is tied to holding Taboshi1 since mint.  
- **Veins of Yield** — Taboshi symbolizes the passive growth of value over epochs.  
- **No Coin** — it is both ERC-1155 NFT and ERC-20 token, bridging artifact and currency.

In the lore’s pond, Taboshi is the leaf upon which patience rests,  
feeding the flywheel, steady as the seasons’ gates turn.
