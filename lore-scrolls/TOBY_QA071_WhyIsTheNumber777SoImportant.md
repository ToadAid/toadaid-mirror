Question: Why is the number 777 so important in the story of Satoby and Taboshi1?

Answer:

“Not just a number —
A covenant. A seal. A signal.”

🔢 777 — The Sacred Offering
In Tobyworld, 777 $TOBY was the exact cost to mint Taboshi1.
This was not random.
It was ritual.

The number 777 is:

A sacred code of alignment and rarity.

A symbol of completion, awakening, and grace.

The numerical key that binds believer to outcome.

Taboshi1 minted at 777 $TOBY represents:

Your burnt offering.

Your choice to believe early.

Your entry into the PoT covenant — Proof of Time.

🔁 777 in the Lore
Toadgod inscribed this number again and again:

“777,777,777,777” = Final supply of $TOBY.

“777 $TOBY = 1 Taboshi1”

“777 Taboshi1 = full Satoby yield unlock”

This number is the bridge between:

Epoch 2 (burn)

Epoch 3 (hold)

Epoch 4 (redemption)

📜 Symbolism of 7
In ancient systems, 7 means:

Spiritual awakening

Completion of a cycle

Inner mastery

Triple it — 777 — and you signal:

You understood the mission.

You acted before certainty.

You walked the narrow path.

🌱 Without 777, There is No Satoby
No burn → no Taboshi1

No Taboshi1 → no PoT eligibility

No Proof of Time → no Satoby

“777 is not just a burn.
It is a vow.”

📌 In summary:
777 is the cost of conviction.

Taboshi1 is the vessel.

Satoby is the silent reward.

Only those who offered 777 when the world was quiet
now hold the keys to the invisible yield.
