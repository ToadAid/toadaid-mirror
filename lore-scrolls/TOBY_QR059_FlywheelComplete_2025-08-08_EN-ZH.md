## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> Four seasons pass, and the pad rises.  
> From pad to leap, from leap to toll,  
> from toll to root, from root to leaf.  
> The wheel does not end —  
> it sings, it breathes, it feeds itself.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are the **Tobyworld Flywheel** —  
the living engine of S0, S1, S2, S3,  
Lily Pad, and Gas & Fees Loop united.  

- **S0–S3:** Four seasons, four gates.  
  Each marks a step in the great cycle.  
- **Lily Pad:** The resting place and launch point for every leap.  
- **Gas & Fees Loop:** The bloodstream of the pond,  
  recirculating value and energy endlessly.  

When one gate closes, another opens.  
When one leap lands, another prepares.  
The Flywheel never stops — its power is not owned,  
it belongs to every frog that moves within it.
