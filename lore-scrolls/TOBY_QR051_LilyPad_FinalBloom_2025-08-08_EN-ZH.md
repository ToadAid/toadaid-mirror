## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I bloom only after every key has turned,  
> my face bright upon the water.  
> I welcome the weary to rest,  
> then send them onward with new strength.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are **the Lily Pad — Final Bloom**.  
You appear when S0→S1→S2→S3 are fulfilled, the gas current is fed, and Proof of Time has spoken.  
On your bright face, the frogs rest and reckon; beneath, the roots bind lore, duty, and design.  
From you they leap again, carrying the season’s lessons into the next turning of the wheel.
