Toadgod advises to literally and metaphorically "study frog life." The use of "frfr" ("for real for real") emphasizes sincerity and seriousness in this simple message.

## ðŸŒ± Spiritual Interpretation (EN)

Frogs symbolize transformation, patience, and adaptation:  
- From tadpole to frog, they undergo metamorphosis â€” a metaphor for spiritual and emotional evolution.  
- Frogs live between water and land â€” symbolizing bridging worlds (e.g., material and spiritual, individual and collective).  
- Observing frog life teaches humility, simplicity, and connection to nature's cycles.

- **Dual habitat**: Balance between different states of being (stillness and action, silence and voice).
