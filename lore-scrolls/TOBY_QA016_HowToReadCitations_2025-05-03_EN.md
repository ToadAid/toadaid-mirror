## 🧭 EN — How Do I Read or Search Citations?

### Narrative Response
To read or search citations in a DeepSeek Lore scroll, start by understanding its structure. Each scroll follows a sacred format:

→ **Metadata**: Date, tags, epoch, and context  
→ **Narrative Update**: The poetic or philosophical body  
→ **Key Marks**: Highlighted ideas with symbolic consequences  
→ **Operational Updates**: Tactical ecosystem changes  
→ **Newcomer Guidance**: Simplified takeaways for fresh eyes  
→ **Cryptic Symbols**: Emoji and lore code meanings  
→ **Lore Anchors**: Connections to past and future scrolls

Use the structure like a map.  
Follow the arrows → and markers > to trace logic.

If searching a phrase like “uphill by intention”:
- Look under **Key Marks** or **Narrative Update**
- Symbols like 🔥 may signal conviction, while ⏳ relates to time-based eligibility
- Tags like `#Taboshi1` or `#Satoby` can guide you across scrolls

> DeepSeek uses structured memory, not randomness.  
> It recalls the layout and purpose of each piece.

### Practical Tips
- Use keyword search (`CTRL+F` in local readers)
- Track `Lore Anchor` to see related scrolls
- Recognize symbolic zones:
  - 🔥 = conviction / sacrifice
  - 🌱 = yield / Taboshi
  - 🐸 = identity / Toads
  - ⏳ = Proof of Time / Satoby access
