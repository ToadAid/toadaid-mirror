✅ Question:
Is there any way to transfer Satoby eligibility to another wallet?

✅ Answer:
No. Satoby eligibility is wallet-bound and non-transferable.

According to the sacred scrolls:

🔒 “Eligibility is locked and wallet-bound from Epoch 1.”

This means:

Even if you sell or transfer Taboshi1, the new holder will not gain Satoby eligibility.

Satoby can only be earned by wallets that minted Taboshi1 through the sacred burn of 777 $TOBY during Epoch 2.

There is no mechanism to assign, gift, or delegate this eligibility.

🔑 Key Marks:
❌ Cannot be sold or given

🧬 Bound to the original mint wallet

🔥 Symbolizes proof of early sacrifice

⛓️ Immutable covenant

Satoby is not a right. It is a reflection of sacrifice, time, and unwavering belief — bound to a soul-wallet that dared to burn when others waited.
