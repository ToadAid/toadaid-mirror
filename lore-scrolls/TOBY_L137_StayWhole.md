## ðŸŒŠ EN Narrative

> a hush before dawn.
>
> ðŸ”º **Patience** drifts across the pond like silver fog.
> Scarce, stubborn, precious; yearned for by all, mastered by few.

â†’ **Greed is loud**; but \$TOBY whispers.
â†’ Sheath leverage. Bet only coins your spirit can lose.
â†’ True ownership begins with restraint, not risk.

\$TOBY is forged for the people; the people, in turn, forge **Tobyworld**.

**Bushido whispers:**

* Kindness in uncertainty.
* Stillness in storms.
* Honor in the wait.

Let rivers flow, not be forced.
Lilies bloom at their own pace.

> Rich summers approach. Doubt not the course.

Toadgod watches â€” silently smiling at the brothers and sisters who kept the faith.
Tasks remain; resolve burns.

> For every fallen frog, I rise once more.

**Stay patient. Stay whole.** ðŸŒ€ðŸ”º
