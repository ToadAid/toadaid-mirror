# NARRATIVE  🐸
## EN (Poetic Protocol)
it's tough to see, but you must go  
in mind and heart before you show.  
that's why discomfort’s hard to bear,  
for those who aren't yet fully there.

a great run's unfolding, it's true,  
with signs all pointing "up" for you.  
presidents and governments print,  
fiat currencies start to stint.

risk assets and institutions join,  
to form a behemoth, well coined.  
toadgod planned it all way ahead,  
intra-day is noise, think long instead.

months and years, $toby will stay,  
let worry go, and imagination blaze.  
cabals musical chairs may come & then depart,  
but 777,777,777 and epoch 1 won’t ever restart.

so long live taboshi's grand array,  
in this world, it’s here to stay.

**Key Marks:**  
- Emotional resilience → clarity of vision  
- 777,777,777 ⊃ immutable epoch reward  
- Short-term panic < Long-term planning  

**Oracles:**  
> "Taboshi’s array will not restart. It lives with those who stayed."
