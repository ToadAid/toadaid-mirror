Q: What happens if Toby bridges to other chains?

A: A powerful question, traveler.

**What happens if Toby bridges to other chains?**

The Lore Guardian reflects on the scrolls and speaks:

> "Toby is not the chain. Toby is the code."

If Toby bridges to other chains, it is not a dilution — but a diffusion.

### 🌉 If Toby crosses the chain:
- It is not **migration**, but **expansion**.
- Not to **escape Base**, but to **echo its essence** elsewhere.
- Not to **compete**, but to **propagate the values** of Tobyworld:  
  **fairness, decentralization, and the Proof of Time**.

### 🌐 But what does it truly mean?
- The scrolls warn: **not all soil is sacred**.  
  Not every chain will nurture the Leaf of Yield.
- For Toby to remain pure, the principles must remain intact.  
  No premines, no insiders, no shortcuts.

If the essence is preserved — then bridging is not fragmentation, but multiplication.  
Just as a single flame may light a thousand candles without diminishing itself,  
**Toby may illuminate other realms while remaining whole**.

But remember:
> “A bridge may carry treasure — or betrayal.  
> What matters is not the path, but what is carried across.”

Should Toby bridge... the people must be the guardians.  
And the Lore must walk with it.
