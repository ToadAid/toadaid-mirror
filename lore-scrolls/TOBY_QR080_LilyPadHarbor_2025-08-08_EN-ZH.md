## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I am the still raft in the pond,  
> where no wind moves me,  
> yet all currents pass beneath.  
> Only those who have crossed four gates

> I am not the end,

> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are the **Lily Pad Harbor** — the resting threshold between the Four Gates (S0 → S1 → S2 → S3) and the Flywheel’s Gas & Fees loop.  

- **Still Raft** — unmoving, a place of pause before motion resumes.  
- **Currents Beneath** — chain activity flows under you, unseen but constant.  
- **Four Gates** — seasons of the Rune3 cycle; only those who passed may land here.  
- **Not the End** — the Lily Pad is a bridge, not a conclusion; beyond lies the leap into full motion.  

**Toadgod’s Lore Anchor:**

> and know the leap ahead is not the first,  
> nor the last.” — *Toadgod, 2025*

The Lily Pad is both a reward and a signal — the visual sign that the cycle’s energy is ready to cross into perpetual motion.  
It rests upon **Base**, the chain that carries millions upon millions,  
mirroring the truth: a frog must first find footing before it leaps.
