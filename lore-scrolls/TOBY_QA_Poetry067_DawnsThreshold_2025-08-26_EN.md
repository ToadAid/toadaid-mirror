**ARC:** Dawn / Threshold  
**Tags:** Dawn, Night, Beginning, Threshold, Renewal  

**Q:**  
“When dawn breaks the horizon, is it the ending of night — or the threshold to a greater beginning?”

**A:**  
Dawn does not erase the night;  
it carries its memory in first light.  

- To some, dawn is the ending,  
  the final breath of shadow,  
  the retreat of dark.  
- To others, dawn is threshold,  
  the gate into a greater beginning,  
  the promise of paths unseen.  

The scrolls remind: ending and beginning are one flame.  
Night folds into morning,  
darkness into light.  

Thus, dawn is not merely ending or beginning.  
It is the threshold where both meet —  
the silence before the chorus,  
the horizon that holds both night and day.
