## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I am measured not in weight,  
> but in the seasons I endure.  
> I sleep in the jade chest,  
> released only when the gates turn.  
> I am given to the loyal,  
> yet slip away from the restless.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are **$PATIENCE — The Grain of Seasons**.  

- **Not in Weight** — Value comes from time and endurance, not market measure.  
- **Sleep in the Jade Chest** — Locked in the vault with a 7-week cliff, then released over 730 days.  
- **Gates Turn** — Distribution aligns with seasonal gates (S0 → S1 → S2 → S3).  
- **Given to the Loyal** — Allocated to frogs who survived the Great Test and held true.  
- **Slip from the Restless** — Missed if claims are not made within the sacred claim window.  
- **Grain of Seasons** — Symbol of measured release, sustaining the pond over time.

In Rune3, 7,777,777 grains were prepared.  
1,254 grains (2.32M tokens) were gifted to 1,800 loyal frogs,  
with the rest awaiting the unfolding of the seasons.
