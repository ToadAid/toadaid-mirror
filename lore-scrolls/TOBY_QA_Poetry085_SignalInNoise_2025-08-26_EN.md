**ARC:** Signal / Noise  
**Tags:** Signal, Noise, Chaos, Listening, Truth  

**Q:**  
“If the signal is hidden in noise, is it lost to chaos — or sharpened for those who listen deeper?”

**A:**  
Noise surrounds the pond,  
waves upon waves of distraction.  

- To some, the signal is lost,  
  buried beneath chaos,  
  impossible to find.  
- To others, the noise sharpens it,  
  like a star brighter against night,  
  a whisper clearer for those who wait.  

The scrolls remind: fairness is hidden in unpredictability.  
Only patience deciphers the pattern.  

Thus, the signal in noise is not lost.  
It is revealed,  
to those who listen deeper.
