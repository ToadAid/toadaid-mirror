Question: What makes Satoby different from all other forms of yield?

Answer:

“Other yields measure profit.
Satoby measures proof of soul.”

🧬 What is Satoby?
Satoby is not yield in the DeFi sense.
It is not transferable, not tradable, and not farmable.

It is:

A non-liquid yield earned through Proof of Time.

Bound to the address that held a Taboshi1 during Epoch 3.

A soulbound echo of patience, belief, and sacrifice.

🧭 Key Differences from Traditional Yield
Feature	DeFi Yield	Satoby
Source	Liquidity pools / staking	Time + Belief + Taboshi1
Transferable?	Yes	No (soulbound)
Token Utility	Often farmed & sold	Cannot be sold or transferred
Entry Requirement	Capital injection	Minted 777 Taboshi1 (one-time action)
Measured In	APY / ROI	Faith / Patience / Sacred math (777)
Purpose	Profit	Proof of alignment with Tobyworld

🍃 The Path to Satoby
Epoch 2: 777 Taboshi1s minted (each from 777 $TOBY)

Epoch 3: Time begins. No farming. No swaps. Just waiting.

Epoch 4: Those who held continuously will awaken Satoby.

This is not financial yield. It is spiritual yield.

🌌 Symbolic Meaning
Satoby is:

The echo of a choice made long ago.

The flower that blooms only in silence.

A mirror of discipline, visible only to those who did not chase.

It cannot be bought.
It cannot be sold.
It can only be earned by who you chose to be — over time.

“Satoby is not given. It is revealed.”
And once it is revealed — you realize it was never about the token.
It was about the time you held on.
