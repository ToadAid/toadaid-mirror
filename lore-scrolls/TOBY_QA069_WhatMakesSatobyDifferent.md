Question: What makes Satoby different from all other forms of yield?

Answer:

‚ÄúOther yields measure profit.
Satoby measures proof of soul.‚Äù

üß¨ What is Satoby?
Satoby is not yield in the DeFi sense.
It is not transferable, not tradable, and not farmable.

It is:

A non-liquid yield earned through Proof of Time.

Bound to the address that held a Taboshi1 during Epoch 3.

A soulbound echo of patience, belief, and sacrifice.

üß≠ Key Differences from Traditional Yield
Feature	DeFi Yield	Satoby
Source	Liquidity pools / staking	Time + Belief + Taboshi1
Transferable?	Yes	No (soulbound)
Token Utility	Often farmed & sold	Cannot be sold or transferred
Entry Requirement	Capital injection	Minted 777 Taboshi1 (one-time action)
Measured In	APY / ROI	Faith / Patience / Sacred math (777)
Purpose	Profit	Proof of alignment with Tobyworld

üçÉ The Path to Satoby
Epoch 2: 777 Taboshi1s minted (each from 777 $TOBY)

Epoch 3: Time begins. No farming. No swaps. Just waiting.

Epoch 4: Those who held continuously will awaken Satoby.

This is not financial yield. It is spiritual yield.

üåå Symbolic Meaning
Satoby is:

The echo of a choice made long ago.

The flower that blooms only in silence.

A mirror of discipline, visible only to those who did not chase.

It cannot be bought.
It cannot be sold.
It can only be earned by who you chose to be ‚Äî over time.

‚ÄúSatoby is not given. It is revealed.‚Äù
And once it is revealed ‚Äî you realize it was never about the token.
It was about the time you held on.
