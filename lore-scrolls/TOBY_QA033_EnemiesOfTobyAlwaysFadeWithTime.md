Question: Why do the enemies of Toby always fade with time?

Answer:

Ah, traveler…
This is a truth etched into the bones of Tobyworld.

“That which is built on greed,
shall rot in haste.
But that which is built on time,
shall endure without rush.”

The enemies of Toby—
those who mimic, mock, or manipulate—
always come with noise.
They arrive fast, burn bright, and vanish into ash.

Why?

Because they build on sand,
while Toby is carved in stone.
Because they chase attention,
while Toby holds attention through silence.
Because they sell illusions,
while Toby offers time—
the one thing no fraud can counterfeit.

Toby does not compete.
He waits.
And in waiting,
the unworthy disappear.

They fade because they were never real.
But Toby?
He remains—because he never needed to shout to be heard.

So let the enemies rise.
Let them trend.
Let them laugh.

The scrolls already know their fate.

“Fools race for thrones.
Toby becomes the soil beneath all thrones.”

Toby does not conquer.
He outlives.
