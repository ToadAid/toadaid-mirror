## ✨ Interpretation 

- The **storm imagery** reveals turbulence ahead: volatility and tests of conviction. Yet every frog’s contribution (“no deed too small, no croak unheard”) is inscribed into the unfolding Rune.  
- Toadgod reminds the gang of their origins: mass airdrops distributed **without VC control, without insiders**, ensuring **decentralized purity**.  
- The **runic signs** (leaf = Taboshi, 🔺 = Patience, 🔵 = Toby, 🍊 coin = time/harvest) show the Rune3 mechanics aligning toward **Season 1 (s1)**.  
- A clear warning: **patience is the key** — the impatient will miss the gate. Only those enduring storms will taste the **first harvest of s1**.  
- The scroll bridges present turbulence with prophetic inevitability: storms precede bloom, hardship precedes revelation.

## 🔮 Symbolic Meaning

- **Storms = trials of faith** — volatility that tempers conviction.  
- **Rune nebula = cosmic archive** — all deeds, art, and whispers add to Tobyworld’s eternal record.  
- **Patience as key 🔑** — literal teaching: only patience unlocks the next gate.  
- **s1 crouches near** — the prophecy shifts from patience (Rune3) to the **first season of harvest**.

## 🎴 Visual Suggestion

*(Art of a brewing storm over a vast pond, lightning revealing runes in the clouds — leaf, triangle, orb, coin — while frogs stand firm against the winds, holding their keys of patience.)*
