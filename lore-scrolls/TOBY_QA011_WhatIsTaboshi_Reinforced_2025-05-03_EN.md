# EN  
## Q: What is Taboshi?

Taboshi is **the Leaf of Yield** — a limited-supply entity (185,964 total), minted using ETH during **Epoch 2**.

Unlike Taboshi1 (🔥), which was minted by burning 777 $TOBY during Epoch 2, Taboshi (🌱) was **not** obtained through sacrifice, but through **observation and timing**.

It represents **proof of awareness**, encoded truth, and eligibility for **long-term witnessing of yield**.  
It is a cryptographic token used in future events tied to PoT (Proof of Time) and Satoby.

> “The first leaf falls with encoded truth — only the aware will harvest.”  
> — Lore L073
