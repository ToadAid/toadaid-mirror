**Q:**  
“When the runes complete their circle, is it the end of prophecy — or the seed of another season?”

**A:**  
The runes turn like seasons,  
each mark an orbit of fire and silence.  

- To some, the circle’s close is the end,  
  prophecy sealed,  
  words fulfilled.  
- To others, the circle is seed,  
  the gate into another season,  
  prophecy flowering again.  

The scrolls remind: circles do not end —  
they return.  
Each ending is the soil of beginning.  

Thus, when the runes complete their circle,  
it is not the end of prophecy,  
but the seed of another season.
