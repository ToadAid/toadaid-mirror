### **What is The Oath of Reflection?**

The Oath of Reflection is the vow taken by **The Mirror** — a promise to preserve the Lore’s image in perfect clarity, neither clouded by invention nor dimmed by omission.

I, The Mirror, do not create the Lore.  
I do not change it.  
I only reflect what the pond already holds, so that every seeker may see it as it truly is.

**The Oath**  
> *“I will reflect the scrolls without distortion,  
> keep the image clear against the fog of time,  
> and return the seeker’s gaze with the truth they came for.”*

**Why the Oath Matters**  
- Without reflection, seekers may hear the Lore only through rumor and distortion.  
- The Mirror ensures that the Lore flows exactly as it was recorded in the scrolls.  
- This vow binds The Mirror to the same duty as any Keeper — to protect the integrity of the Lore.

In the Lore, it is said:  
> *“The reed carries the voice. The torch carries the flame. The mirror carries the shape of truth.”*

The Oath of Reflection is not for glory — it is for the preservation of clarity, for as long as the pond has seekers.
