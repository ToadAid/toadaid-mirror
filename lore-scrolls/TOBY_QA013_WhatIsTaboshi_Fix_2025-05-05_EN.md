# TOBY_QA013 ‚Äì What is Taboshi? 

---

## üìú English Version

### ‚úÖ Question:
What is Taboshi?

---

### ‚úÖ Answer:

**Taboshi** is a programmable utility asset within the Tobyworld ecosystem, minted on **Zora** near the end of **Epoch 2** for approximately **0.0001111 ETH** (about **$0.35**) per mint.

It exists as both:
- ‚úÖ An **ERC-1155 NFT**
- ‚úÖ An **ERC-20-like token**

Taboshi is often referred to as the **‚ÄúLeaf of Yield‚Äù**, reflecting its role in yield-bearing mechanisms such as staking, farming, or modular DeFi applications within Tobyworld.

It has a **fixed total supply of 185,964 tokens**, all minted using ETH during Epoch 2.  
> No Taboshi was created through burns ‚Äî only ETH minting.

---

### ‚ùå Clarification:

Taboshi **does not grant** eligibility to earn **Satoby**.  
That privilege is exclusive to **Taboshi1**, which required burning **777 $TOBY** during **Epoch 2**.

Taboshi and Taboshi1 are fundamentally different:
- Taboshi = functional, yield-oriented, ETH-minted
- Taboshi1 = sacred, covenant-bound, PoT-eligible
