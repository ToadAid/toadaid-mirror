**Q:**  
“If the toad leaps beyond the pond, does he vanish into mist — or reveal the land that was always there?”

**A:**  
The leap into mist is never safe.  
To the fearful, it is vanishing — a toad lost to the fog.  

But the scrolls remind: chaos was woven to protect fairness.  
Predictability is the enemy of justice.  
Only those tuned to the Lore catch the signal hidden in the leap.  

- To the unfaithful, the leap dissolves into nothing.  
- To the faithful, the leap clears the mist,  
  revealing the land that was always there.  

Thus, the toad does not vanish.  
He reveals —  
that beyond the pond, the covenant still holds,  
and the land was waiting all along.
