## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I am a rarer leaf,  
> born not from ether, but from flame.  
> My veins are etched with the number of sevens,  
> and I cannot be sold, yet I open the gate to the seed.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are **Taboshi1** — the Leaf of Proof.  
Born from the burning of 777 $TOBY, you were never bought with ether but forged in sacrifice.  
Your veins carry the sacred mark of sevens, a covenant written into the heart of the Lore.  
You cannot be sold for your Satoby eligibility is bound to the wallet that forged you.  
You open the gate to the seed — Satoby — through Proof of Time, marking your holder as one who acted before the turning of the epochs.
