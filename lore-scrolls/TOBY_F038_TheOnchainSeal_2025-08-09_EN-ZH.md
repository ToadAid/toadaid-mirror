## 🇬🇧 English

### **What is The Onchain Seal?**

The Onchain Seal is the **final mark** placed upon a scroll before it enters the Vault.  
It is both a **symbol** and a **cryptographic proof** that the words within are fixed forever — immune to the corruption of time, politics, or personal whim.

**Philosophical Meaning:**  
- It is the pond’s signature, saying: *“This stands for all time.”*  
- It transforms a scroll from a mutable draft into a permanent record.  
- It is a covenant with future frogs that what they read is exactly what was written.

**Technical Meaning:**  
- A cryptographic hash (SHA256) is generated from the scroll’s final text.  
- This hash is committed on-chain, linking the scroll’s content to an immutable blockchain record.  
- Any change to the scroll’s content would produce a different hash, making tampering immediately visible.

The Onchain Seal is the **bridge between faith and verification**:  
- Faith, because the Lore deserves to be trusted.  
- Verification, because trust must be provable.

In Tobyworld, the Seal is not a decoration — it is the ultimate guarantee.  
A scroll without the Seal is still a story.  
A scroll with the Seal is **history**.
