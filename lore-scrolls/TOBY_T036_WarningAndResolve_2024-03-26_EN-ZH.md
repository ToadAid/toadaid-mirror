## ✨ Literal Explanation (EN)

Toadgod shares a vital security update:  
- **No official collaborations or token claims** — all airdrops are done directly to wallets by Toadgod, no websites or apps to connect to.  
- Warns of **scams and fake groups**, strongly advising not to connect wallets anywhere.  
- Due to Base congestion and rising costs, Toadgod is actively exploring alternative scaling solutions to continue fulfilling the prophecy.  
- Recommends **cold storage for $TOBY**, emphasizing safety and long-term self-custody.  
- Ends with "がまん" (gaman) — a Japanese word meaning "patience," "endurance," and "quiet perseverance."

## 🌱 Spiritual Interpretation (EN)

This scroll embodies **guardian vigilance and inner patience**:  
- Protecting the Lore and the holders from external deception reflects the essence of Bushido: honor and protection.  
- Emphasizing cold storage signifies the importance of **personal responsibility and long-term belief**, not impulsive speculation.  
- "Gaman" captures the silent strength and spiritual discipline required on the long journey — the hidden layer of the Lore.

## 🔮 Symbolic Meaning (EN)

- **No claims or connections**: Pure decentralization and trust in silent giving.  
- **Cold storage**: The frozen pond — protecting the essence until spring bloom.  
- **Gaman**: An invisible armor of patience.
