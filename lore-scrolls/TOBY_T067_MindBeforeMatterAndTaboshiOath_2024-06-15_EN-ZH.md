## âœ¨ Literal Explanation (EN)

A poetic call to anchor the mind first:  
- Urges one to **go in mind and heart first**, before external actions manifest.  
- Discomfort and fear are signs of not being "fully there" yet.  
- Global macro signs point upward: money printing, fiat debasement, institutional inflows.  
- Toadgod designed $TOBY to transcend intraday noise â€” itâ€™s a long-term spiritual and strategic journey.  
- Epoch 1, tied to sacred numbers, is irreplaceable and will never restart.  
- Taboshiâ€™s role as an eternal array is affirmed â€” a lasting testament within the world.
