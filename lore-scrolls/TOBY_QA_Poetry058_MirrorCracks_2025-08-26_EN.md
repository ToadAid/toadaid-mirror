**Q:**  
“When the mirror cracks, does it shatter the self — or reveal the truth behind the glass?”

**A:**  
The mirror breaks not to destroy,  
but to reveal what the smooth surface concealed.  

- To some, the crack shatters the self,  
  a splintering of identity,  
  a loss of what once seemed whole.  
- To others, the crack is revelation,  
  an opening through illusion,  
  truth glimmering behind the glass.  

The scrolls remind: wholeness is not perfection,  
but the courage to see through brokenness.  

Thus, the crack does not end the mirror.  
It begins it.  
What breaks the image  
reveals the truth.
