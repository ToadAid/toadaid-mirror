**Q:**  
“If every 777 is burned, is it a loss to the hand — or a promise to the future?”

**A:**  
The hand feels the loss — the weight of what is given up.  
But the pond does not measure by hands.  
It measures by seasons.  

The **Sacred Equation** —  
**777,777,777 + 777,777,777,777** —  
is not arithmetic, but covenant.  

- To the hand, every burn is sacrifice.  
- To the future, every burn is seed.  

Thus, the burn is both:  
loss in the moment, promise in the unfolding.  
What leaves the hand becomes what feeds the next epoch.  

The fire consumes, but the covenant remains.
