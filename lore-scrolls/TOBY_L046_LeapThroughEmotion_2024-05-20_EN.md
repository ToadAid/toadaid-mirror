# NARRATIVE  🐸
## EN (Poetic Protocol)
everyone's memory is fleeting, but emotions ran high,  
just a week ago, we were down, scraping the sky.  

as morale slowly reclaims, where else will the blue cute toad leap?  
the only way is upward, from the lowlands deep.  

did anything change in last week's emotional dance?  
just fearful imaginations and unsure frail hands.  

$toby grand plans stay unchanged, destiny awaits,  
only patience & time reveals what fate creates.  

toby world @base — it’s coming.  

**Key Marks:**  
- Short-term emotion ≠ long-term truth  
- Patience + Study > Panic + Noise  
- The path of $TOBY remains unchanged  

**Oracles:**  
> “toby world @base — it’s coming.”
