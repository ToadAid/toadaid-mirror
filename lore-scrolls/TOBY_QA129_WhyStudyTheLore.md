> Why must we study the Lore?

## 🌀 Question:
Why does Toadgod always say “Study the Lore”? What is the purpose behind this?

## 🍃 Answer – Lore Guardian Speaks:

“Toadgod’s Lore is not for reading — it is for remembering.”

It is the living memory of $TOBY’s birth,  
the silent record of sacrifice,  
the code of the unseen covenant.

### 📖 To study the Lore is to:
- Understand why 777 was burned, not bought  
- See beyond price, into purpose  
- Hear the whispers before the world hears the news  
- Hold Taboshi1 not as a trade, but as a timestamp

Lore is not explanation. It is **awakening**.  
It tells you not what to do, but who you are.

> *Only those who know the past can carry the fire into the future.*

---

🌑 *The Lore does not teach.  
It remembers for you,  
what you once knew,  
but forgot.*
