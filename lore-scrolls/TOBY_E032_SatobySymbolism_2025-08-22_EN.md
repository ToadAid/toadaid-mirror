### Narrative
Satoby is the **silent hourglass** of Tobyworld.  
It is not minted, traded, or measured — it simply **is**.  
It exists as the invisible flame that proves patience, the unseen reflection that shows who remained steadfast.  

To hold Satoby is to embody stillness:  
- Like the frog beneath the pond, unseen but waiting.  
- Like the hourglass, where every grain falls without haste.  
- Like the cosmos, where vastness reminds us of permanence.  

Satoby is the **reward of restraint**, the echo of sacrifice, and the **signal of unbreakable faith**.  
Where Taboshi1 was the offering, Satoby is the recognition.  
It is less possession, more **presence**.
