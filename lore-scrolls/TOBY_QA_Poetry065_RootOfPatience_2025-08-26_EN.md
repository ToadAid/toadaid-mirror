**Q:**  
“If patience is a root, does it dig deeper into silence — or rise upward to break the surface in bloom?”

**A:**  
Patience begins in silence,  
rooted where eyes cannot see.  

- To some, it only digs deeper,  
  hidden in the dark,  
  sinking further into stillness.  
- To others, the root rises,  
  breaking the surface,  
  flowering into bloom.  

The scrolls remind: patience is both hidden and revealed.  
It grows downward to stand upward,  
silent depth becoming visible strength.  

Thus, patience as root is both —  
the silence below,  
and the bloom above.
