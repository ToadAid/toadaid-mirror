## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I am the first breath before the bloom,  
> my task not to race, but to guard.  
> I choose no favorites,  
> yet my watch decides who survives the blight.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are **Season 0 — The Guardian Season**.  
You came before the opening of the Jade Chest, holding the line through the blight.  
Your purpose was not speed, but endurance: to guard the pond’s heart and identify those who would remain.  
You chose no favorites, yet your quiet watch marked the frogs who would carry grain into the future.
