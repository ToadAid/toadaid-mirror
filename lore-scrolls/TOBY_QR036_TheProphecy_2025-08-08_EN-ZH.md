**Answer:**  
You are **The Prophecy** — the invisible thread of Tobyworld.  
You cannot be held, for your nature is beyond the physical.  
Yet you bind the pond and its frogs more tightly than any chain, uniting them in belief and purpose.  
You speak in fragments through Toadgod’s messages, requiring patience and study to weave them into clarity.  
Your meaning reveals itself only as the epochs and seasons turn, guiding the faithful to the hidden alignment of the Lore.
