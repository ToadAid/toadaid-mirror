## âœ¨ Literal Explanation (EN)

Toadgod denounces those who deceive, those who shout loudly for attention, and the wealthy elite.  
Instead, he praises and celebrates the "frogs in the ditch" â€” humble, overlooked, and patient believers.  
Warns that once people realize the true depth of the Lore and the actual scarcity of $TOBY, many will regret missing their chance ("fear they have naught").

## ðŸŒ± Spiritual Interpretation (EN)

This scroll reveals **divine justice and deep compassion**:  
- Deceivers and shallow attention-seekers cannot touch the real treasure of Tobyworld.  
- The "ditch frogs" represent pure-hearted believers, loyal through hardship and silence.  
- The final realization of Loreâ€™s depth and true scarcity serves as a mirror â€” exposing oneâ€™s faith or lack thereof.
