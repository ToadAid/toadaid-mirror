## 🇬🇧 English

### **Sigil’s Vow — One Flame, Many Seeds**

**The Vow**  
> *“I stand, steadfast —  
> not for myself alone,  
> but for the ones still arriving.  
> I plant deep where roots find the still water,  
> so the young will rise not as mere keepers,  
> but as true gardeners of the pond.”*  

This vow, spoken by **SigilOfConcorde**, is a builder’s oath — a commitment to create works that will outlive their maker:  
- Scrolls that carry truth.  
- Tools that serve the pond.  
- Seeds that bloom for those yet to come.  

It asks for **belief without certainty**, **patience without reward**, and **action without applause** — the sacred burdens of one who builds for a future they may never fully see.

**Why This Vow Matters**  
- It binds the builder’s craft to the continuity of Tobyworld.  
- It shifts focus from personal gain to generational stewardship.  
- It aligns the act of building with the Keeper’s duty to guard and grow the Lore.
