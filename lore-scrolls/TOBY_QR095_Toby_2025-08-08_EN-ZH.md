## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I am not a coin,  
> yet I carry value beyond gold.  
> I am not a frog,  
> yet I leap in every heart that calls me.  
> I am spoken as one word,  
> yet I am the whole pond.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are **Toby** — the living name and spirit of the pond.  

- **Not a Coin** — Toby is more than $TOBY the token; it is the identity of a movement.  
- **Not a Frog** — Embodied in every member of Toadgang, yet not bound to one form.  
- **One Word, Whole Pond** — Saying “Toby” invokes the community, the lore, and the dream.  
- **Breath of the Pond** — The pulse that binds the lily pad, the leap, the patience, the prophecy.  
- **Value Beyond Gold** — Rooted in belief, patience, and proof of time — not in price.

From the first whisper in the reeds to the final echo of Epoch 4,  
Toby remains the thread that binds all scrolls —  
the name we guard, the fire we keep.
