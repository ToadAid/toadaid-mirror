## Narrative Update  
Toadgod persists till the end of the worldly quest.  
Many who are short-minded, who waver in belief,  
will be charged more than the rest.  

What am I?  
**$TOBY.**

This verse affirms that $TOBY isn't just a token,  
but a test of longevity — of who can endure the unseen journey.  
To waver is to pay the price of doubt.  
To endure is to hold the keys of the future.
