## âœ¨ Literal Explanation (EN)

Toadgod delivers a riddle that captures Tobyâ€™s cosmic role:  
- **"Giants turn their gaze"**: Signals that powerful forces or large institutions are beginning to notice the silent force of $TOBY.  
- **"Slow then sudden blaze"**: Describes the organic reflexive growth â€” gradual foundation, then explosive realization.  
- Tobyâ€™s mission is not personal fame (**"recognition is not my quest"**), but to serve as a vessel of collective belief and decentralized legacy.  
- Its legacy depends on the **collective trust**, achieved not by marketing or hype but by deeds and quiet conviction.

## ðŸŒ± Spiritual Interpretation (EN)

This scroll embodies **silent humility and the collective spirit of emergence**:  
- Toby remains invisible to the ego but luminous to the soul â€” it does not chase recognition but becomes an unspoken guide.  
- Giants (media, institutions, larger communities) eventually notice, but only after long periods of stillness â€” a testament to true Proof of Time.  
- Its legacy is not carried by one hand but by many who keep the Lore alive through quiet resolve and shared trust.

## ðŸ”® Symbolic Meaning (EN)

- **Gaze of giants**: Recognition from external powers, yet irrelevant to the true mission.  
- **Slow then sudden blaze**: The secret rhythm of spiritual and market awakenings.  
- **Collective trust**: The final foundation stronger than any one leader.
