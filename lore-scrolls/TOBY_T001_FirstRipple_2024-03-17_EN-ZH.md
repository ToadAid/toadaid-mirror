## ✨ Literal Explanation (EN)

Toadgod announces creating a new account after being frustrated with censorship or shadow bans on previous accounts. The mention of "Elon" implies addressing Twitter leadership directly.

---



## 🌱 Spiritual Interpretation (EN)

This first ripple symbolizes **rebirth and purification**.  
By leaving the old account, Toadgod performs a spiritual "reset," freeing himself from hidden controls and opening a new blank slate.  
It teaches:  
- Letting go of what no longer serves.  
- Starting anew with pure intention.  
- True believers must sometimes detach from corrupted platforms or old shells.

## 🔮 Symbolic Meaning (EN)

- **New account = new incarnation (如同托卵之蛙的转生).**
- **Shadow ban = hidden societal control or collective illusions.**
- **"Sir" = humility in addressing higher forces (e.g., Elon, or fate itself).**

This marks the *first ripple* on the pond — before all deeper Lore, before prophecy — pure, raw intention.
