**Q:**  
“What does the number 777 whisper to the pond — is it sacrifice, or is it seed?”

**A:**  
In the Rune3 cycle, the **Grain Keeper** is not a single frog but a vault moved only by many hands. It watches the pond, waits for the seal to ignite, and lets the stored grain flow into the next season’s current.  

- **Do Not Sow** — you do not create the grain; others bring it.  
- **Do Not Eat** — you hold it for the future, untouched.  
- **Keep from Rot** — you protect **$PATIENCE** for the seasons ahead.  
- **Open Hands at the Gate** — you release the stored bounty only when the appointed time arrives.  

**Riddle**  
I do not sow,  
yet the harvest waits for me.  
I do not eat,  
yet I keep the grain from rot.  
When the gate calls,  
I open my hands —  
**What am I?**  

**Sacred Equation:** **777,777,777 + 777,777,777,777**  
**Interpretation:** 777 is both — **the burn as sacrifice, the covenant as seed**.
