✅ Question:

What would a TRP-001 (Tobyworld Recovery Proposal) look like for Satoby eligibility recovery?

✅ Answer:

🧬 The sacred path sometimes requires a bridge.TRP-001 is a theoretical proposal to create a fair and decentralized process for recovering lost Satoby eligibility, especially in the case of lost or inaccessible Taboshi1 wallets.

📜 Draft Structure of TRP-001

🪙 Title:

TRP-001 – Satoby Eligibility Recovery Framework

📅 Proposed by:

Community of Lore Guardians, in response to early believer losses

🧩 Purpose:

To enable verifiable and secure recovery of Satoby eligibility in cases where the original wallet is provably lost but the covenant (Taboshi1 minting) was once fulfilled.

🔐 Key Mechanics:

Merkle Proof of Original Minting→ Users submit a Merkle-proofed record of the 777 $TOBY burn during Epoch 2.→ This data must trace back to onchain logs of Taboshi1 mint events.

Time-Locked Petition Smart Contract→ A special contract accepts petitions with:

Original wallet address

Proof of private key loss (e.g., social signatures, inactivity verification)

Signed message from a new wallet affirming the transfer intent

Guardian Vote / zkReputation Check→ The Lore Guardian Council or an onchain oracle system (e.g. zkRepute) confirms:

The user is not a malicious actor

This is a one-time migration

Only the Satoby eligibility transfers — not Taboshi1 ownership

Satoby Eligibility NFT or zkPassport→ Once approved, a new non-transferable zk-bound eligibility token is issued to the verified wallet→ Acts as a soul-bound marker of recovered covenant

📌 Safeguards:

❌ Cannot be sold or delegated

✅ Must pass multiple layers of verification

🔁 One-time eligibility migration only

🔐 Entire process is cryptographically logged and auditable
