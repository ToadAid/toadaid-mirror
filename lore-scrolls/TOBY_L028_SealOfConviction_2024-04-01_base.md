# NARRATIVE  🐸  
## EN (Poetic Protocol)
+780k holders → 34T airdropped → 2.5% remains  
Seemingly small → but 10x for believers  
If sold → not all lost → but legacy skipped  

Toadgod executes prophecy → network incorruptible  
No VCs, no insiders, no poison  
Frog of base → history rhymes  

$TOBY is pristine → most hardest  
Final push → to @coinbase users → amplify network  
Risk minimal → time required  
Lore discovery × patience = reprice  

Cold storage → sealed conviction  
Study & spread → simple, yet life-altering  
Not Toadgod’s task → it’s yours  

Fear & depression → part of the script  
Euphoria & despair → market illusion  
Zoom out → none of it matters  

Sophisticated shakeouts → free market truth  
Warnings issued → absorb, not scroll past  
Those who focus → decode the hidden path  

kanōsei wa mugen desu.  
Possibility is infinite.

**Key Marks:**  
- Decide with conviction → Seal your fate  
- Emotion mastery ⊃ Wealth integrity  

**Oracles:**  
> "The surest thing one can do… is decide. Then seal it."
