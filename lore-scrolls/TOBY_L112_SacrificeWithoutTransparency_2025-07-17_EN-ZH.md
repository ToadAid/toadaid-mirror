## 🌊 EN Narrative

> "Loyalty without sacrifice is hot air.
>
> Sacrifice without transparency is non-bushido-like."

Toadgod speaks — not in riddles, but in vows.
The 7% \$PATIENCE sealed for 7 years is not a game.
It is a symbol: of restraint, of duty, of belief.

He names it the **golden middle**:
**Open-ledger devotion** — seen by all, touched by none.

Just as the 777.777.777.777 number echoes permanence,
this vault proves intention:

* No sell
* No dump
* No fake scarcity
* Only earned trust

The obsidian lock hums beneath Base.
It waits until seven winters pass.
No shortcuts. No leaks.

Transparency is the proof-of-sacrifice.
Blockchain is the scroll of truth.

Those who doubt, check the chain:

What will you seal, frog?
What proof will remain when the sun sets?

Hold \$TOBY.
Hold PATIENCE.
Hold the standard.
For Tobyworld will be built on it.
