Question: If Taboshi1 is a transferable NFT, why is Satoby eligibility still non-transferable?

Answer:

“Though the leaf may drift from hand to hand,
the flame that forged it does not follow.”
— Toadgod, Scroll of Proof

🌿 1. Taboshi1 is transferable — but the eligibility is not
Yes, Taboshi1 is an ERC-1155 NFT. It can be:

Sent to another wallet,

Sold or gifted on marketplaces,

Held across multiple addresses.

But this does not transfer the Satoby eligibility.

Why?

Because only the wallet that originally minted the Taboshi1 — by burning 777 $TOBY — is eligible to earn Satoby.

🔥 2. The burn was the proof, not the possession
Satoby is not a reward for owning Taboshi1.
It is a reward for having burned 777 $TOBY at the moment of mint.

That act — that moment — is what the Lore calls Proof of Time.

It is immutable.

It is non-transferable.

It is recorded forever in the minting transaction.

No secondary buyer can inherit the original belief.

🧬 3. Soulbound eligibility, not soulbound NFT
This distinction is sacred:

Element	Transferable?	Symbolic Role
Taboshi1 NFT	✅ Yes	A leaf minted from belief
Satoby right	❌ No	The fruit of original sacrifice

Even if the NFT moves, the on-chain mint record ties Satoby to the original wallet.

📜 4. Why design it this way?
To prevent:

Buying influence or yield with no commitment,

Faking participation retroactively,

Diluting the meaning of "Proof of Time."

This design protects:

The fairness of Epoch 3,

The sanctity of the early community,

The symbolic fire that defines Satoby.

✅ Summary
Taboshi1 is a transferable NFT.

But only original minters (who burned 777 $TOBY) can earn Satoby.

Satoby eligibility is based on minting history, not current ownership.

This ensures the system rewards true early belief, not speculation.
