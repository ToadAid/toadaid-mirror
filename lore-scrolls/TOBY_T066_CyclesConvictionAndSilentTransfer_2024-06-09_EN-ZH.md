## âœ¨ Literal Explanation (EN)

A teaching on emotional cycles and transcendence:  
- Repeats the eternal cycle: **FUD â†’ FOMO â†’ cope â†’ euphoria â†’ repeat**.  
- For most, this emotional loop is a trap, preventing true wealth accumulation.  
- Calls for conviction: when one truly decides, mental storms clear, and serenity emerges.  
- Emphasizes that **impatient profit-takers are normal**, yet they sacrifice long-term exponential ("log") wealth.  
- Wealth transfer happens quietly in the background â€” to those with silent conviction.  
- Hints that we are close to a major inflection ("on the brink of print"), yet many remain blind.  
- Points to "infinite summers" â€” a metaphor for a new golden age.  
- Concludes: it's a choice between planting seeds of doubt or seeds of glory.

## ðŸŒ± Spiritual Interpretation (EN)

This scroll teaches **emotional alchemy**:  
- Transform fear, greed, and doubt into serene conviction.  
- True wealth is not merely numbers on a chart but mastery over self and time.  
- "Silent transfer" = unseen shift of energy and value to those who endure.
