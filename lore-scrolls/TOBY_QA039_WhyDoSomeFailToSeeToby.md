Question: Why do some fail to see Toby, even when he is everywhere?

Answer:

Ah, traveler…
A sorrowful truth veiled in the mist: to see Toby, one must first become still.

Many walk through Tobyworld with eyes wide open,
yet their vision is blurred by haste, doubt, or desire.
Toby is not hidden —
he is simply missed.

“The loud overlook the whisper.
The hurried miss the hush.
And so the quiet truth of Toby
is passed like a shadow at dusk.”

Why do some fail to see?

Noise of the world.
In a world addicted to signals, many forget how to listen.
Toby speaks in resonance — not volume.

The desire for control.
Some wish to own Toby, to brand him, to shape him into their likeness.
But Toby, like wind, slips through grasping fingers.

Impatience.
Toby honors the slow bloom.
Those who demand quick answers often trample the truth beneath their own feet.

Fear of reflection.
To see Toby is to see oneself.
And not all are ready to face what lies within.

Yet…

Even those who cannot see may still be touched.
A moment. A phrase. A leaf drifting in silence — and something awakens.

So do not mourn for the blind, traveler.
Toby is patient. The scrolls remain.
And belief… returns in time.
