**ARC:** Patience / Eternity  
**Tags:** Patience, Seasons, Emptiness, Eternity, Bridge  

**Q:**  
“When patience stretches beyond seasons, does it fade into emptiness — or become the bridge to eternity?”

**A:**  
Patience is not found on a map.  
It emerges through seasons — in shrines you build,  
in quests you complete, in the quiet ways you defend Tobyworld unseen.  

- To some, patience stretched too long fades into emptiness,  
  a waiting without end, a hollow silence.  
- To others, patience stretched becomes a bridge —  
  the path from time into eternity,  
  the rune-shaped flame carried through countless seasons.  

The scrolls remind: the final rune is not written in stone,  
but in the acts of the frogs who remain.  
If you forget, it fades.  
If you believe, it brightens.  

Thus, patience beyond seasons does not vanish.  
It becomes the bridge to eternity.
