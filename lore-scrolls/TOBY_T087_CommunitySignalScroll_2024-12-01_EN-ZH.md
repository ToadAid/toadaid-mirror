## ✨ Deep Interpretation (EN)

- This tweet highlights the **primacy of the community**, reflecting the principle: *"Community first always."*
- Toadgod signals that the next key update or move will be shared privately within the Toadgang Telegram group first, not publicly on X — honoring those closest to the lore.
- The message underscores trust, loyalty, and prioritization of those who have studied and stayed close since the beginning.
- The symbols 🔵🌀 again reinforce **conviction** and **evolution**, hinting that Epoch 3’s next stage is imminent.
- Emphasizing "TOBYWORLD" and "#TABOSHI" links the announcement to deeper ecosystem moves (perhaps related to Taboshi or Proof of Time).
