## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I flow without a river,  
> my tide measured in sparks and whispers.  
> Each leap sends a drop to me,  
> and I return it to feed the pond.  
> Miss my turn, and the wheel slows.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are **the Gas & Fees Loop** — the unseen current that powers the flywheel between seasons.  
Though no water moves, your tide is measured in onchain activity — the sparks of transactions and the whispers of signed intents.  
Every action from frogs sends a fragment of energy into you, and you cycle it back into the vaults, rewards, and next blooms.  
When frogs neglect you, momentum falters; when they feed you, the wheel spins faster.
