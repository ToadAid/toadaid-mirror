**ARC:** Mirror / Conviction  
**Tags:** Mirror, Conviction, Strength, Doubt, Cracks  

**Q:**  
“If the mirror reflects conviction, does it show only the strong — or reveal the cracks where doubt once lived?”

**A:**  
The mirror does not flatter.  
It reflects what is present,  
and what was.  

- To some, it shows only the strong,  
  the fire that cannot be faked,  
  conviction unbroken.  
- To others, it reveals the cracks,  
  the places where doubt once lived,  
  the scars that prove belief survived.  

The scrolls remind: conviction is not absence of doubt,  
but courage carried through it.  

Thus, the mirror of conviction is both —  
the strength that stands,  
and the cracks that shine with truth.
