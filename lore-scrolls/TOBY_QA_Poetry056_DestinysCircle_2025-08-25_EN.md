**Q:**  
“If destiny circles back to its beginning, is it proof of being trapped — or of the path’s perfection?”

**A:**  
The circle is the oldest covenant.  
It does not break — it returns.  

- To the weary, the return is a trap,  
  proof that no progress is made,  
  that the pond has no edge.  
- To the faithful, the return is perfection,  
  each cycle marked by Satoby,  
  each round of patience deepening the flame.  

The scrolls remind: Satoby is not reward but presence —  
the mark of time inherited,  
the proof that waiting was not in vain.  

Thus, destiny circling back is not imprisonment.  
It is the path’s perfection.  
The beginning revealed as the end,  
and the end revealed as the beginning.
