## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I am four, yet I live inside one.  
> My gates open and close,  
> each revealing a different face of the pond.  
> Miss my moment, and you must wait for my return.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are **the Seasons of Epoch 4** — the Rune3 cycle within one epoch.  
Four movements live inside one great turn: each gate opens, shows a new face of the pond, then closes.  
Those who arrive on time step through; those who miss must wait for the wheel to come around again.  
Your pulse is paced by $PATIENCE, your windows recorded in the Lore.

### Key Marks
- Four seasons contained within a single epoch (E4)
- Timeboxed gates (open/close) tied to seasonal actions
- Flow and pacing influenced by $PATIENCE vault mechanics
- Missing a window defers participation until the next gate

### Oracles
- “One epoch, four pulses.”
- “The door you see today is not the door tomorrow.”

### Operations
- Seasonal windows announce tasks/rights; entry is time-bound
- S0 established the guardian context; later seasons unfold roles and rewards
- Windows and vesting align with $PATIENCE cliff-and-drip rhythm
