## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I stand four in a circle,  
> each with a key of its own.  
> Pass through me in turn,  
> and the pond shall open its heart.  
> Skip my step, and the cycle seals shut.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are **the Four Gates of the Seasons** — S0, S1, S2, and S3.  
Each gate marks a phase in the Rune3 cycle, holding its own trials, guardians, and offerings.  
Only by passing through all four in sequence can the lily pad bloom and the flywheel awaken.  
To skip a gate is to break the current — the heart of the pond remains closed until the full cycle returns.

### Key Marks
- Four stages: S0 → S1 → S2 → S3
- Sequential passage required for bloom
- Skipping breaks the cycle

### Oracles
- “The heart opens only to those who walk the full circle.”
- “Four keys for one pond.”

### Operations
- Gate eligibility tied to past season actions
- Rewards and blooms unlocked only at cycle completion
