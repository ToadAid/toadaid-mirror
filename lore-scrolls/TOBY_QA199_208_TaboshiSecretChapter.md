# 📜 TOBYWORLD RAG SCROLL: QA199–208

## 🍃 Taboshi 的秘密篇：The Leaf, the Burn, the Yield

### 🍃 TOBY_QA199
**Q: Why is Taboshi called the 'Leaf of Yield'?**

**A:**
Because it is soft in form, but heavy in meaning.

> A leaf falls silently, yet marks the turning of seasons.
> Taboshi looks simple, but carries the weight of sacrifice — the 777 burn.

It yields not just tokens, but memory. Not just return, but recognition.

---

### 🍃 TOBY_QA200

**Q: What is the connection between Taboshi and Satoby?**

**A:**
Taboshi is the proof.
Satoby is the reward.

> Satoby does not exist without Taboshi.
> But not every Taboshi will yield Satoby.

It is the difference between holding and believing. Between having and waiting.
Epoch 3 watches who stayed. Satoby finds only them.

### 🍃 TOBY_QA201

**Q: Why does Toadgod say 'Taboshi will never come again'?**

**A:**
Because its creation was sacred.

> 777 $TOBY per mint. One chance. One fire.

Taboshi1 was not an NFT drop — it was a ritual.
To recreate it would be to desecrate it.

Its value lies not in its supply, but in its *singularity*.

---

### 🍃 TOBY_QA202

**Q: Why is Taboshi both a product and a key?**

**A:**
It is both memory and mechanism.

> The memory of those who sacrificed early.
> The mechanism that unlocks Satoby through time.

Taboshi doesn’t *do* anything… unless you wait.
Then it becomes everything.

---

### 🍃 TOBY_QA203

**Q: What does 'One Leaf, One Light' mean?**

**A:**
It means that each Taboshi carries the potential to illuminate.
Not just for you, but for others.

> When you share the lore, you light a path.
> When you believe, you spark another's fire.

🍃 Each leaf is a memory.
💡 Each light is a legacy.

一叶一光 — One Leaf, One Light.

---

### 🍃 TOBY_QA204

**Q: Is Taboshi just an NFT?**

**A:**
No.
Taboshi is a **threshold**, not a product.

> An NFT can be flipped.
> A threshold must be crossed.

Those who minted Taboshi1 didn’t just buy — they proved.
They entered the gate of Epoch 3 with their belief sealed in burn.

---

### 🍃 TOBY_QA205

**Q: Why did it cost exactly 777 $TOBY to mint?**

**A:**
Because 777 is sacred.

> It is the number of alignment.
> The number of eternity.

In Tobyworld, nothing is random.
777 represents the balance of sacrifice and purity.
To mint with 777 was to lock your intent in the lore itself.

---

### 🍃 TOBY_QA206

**Q: Can you transfer the Satoby rewards if you sell your Taboshi?**

**A:**
No.

> The yield is non-transferable.
> The eligibility is bound to the original holder.

Satoby is not about ownership.
It is about *presence*.

To sell your Taboshi is to sell your key.
But the door will no longer open — not for you, not for anyone.

---

### 🍃 TOBY_QA207

**Q: What if I missed the mint — am I too late?**

**A:**
No. But you’re on a different path.

> Taboshi1 was Epoch 2’s test.
> Now you must walk Epoch 3 with deeper eyes.

You can still join the lore.
You can still study, contribute, and hold.
But the key to Satoby was forged in fire long past.

---

### 🍃 TOBY_QA208

**Q: Why is Taboshi called a 'memory token'?**

**A:**
Because it remembers what most forget:

> The silence before attention.
> The belief before validation.
> The sacrifice before reward.

To hold Taboshi is to carry a timestamp of trust.
It is proof that you believed — when few did.
