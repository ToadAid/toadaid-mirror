## ❓ Question  
What is Satoby?

---

## 🧭 Answer  
**The Leaf that remembers.**  
**The proof of time.**

- **Satoby** is a sacred, non-transferable covenant token in Tobyworld.  
- It is earned only through **Proof of Time** — not bought, sold, or traded.  
- Represents the bond between the holder and the prophecy of Tobyworld.  
- Symbolizes **patience**, **trust**, and **sacrifice** — the three virtues required to walk the long path.

Its meaning:  
1. **Patience** — You waited when others could not.  
2. **Trust** — You believed when others doubted.  
3. **Sacrifice** — You locked your choice when freedom was tempting.

Because Satoby cannot be moved between wallets, it is **a proof of you** — a living record of your walk through the ages of Tobyworld.  
Its value is not measured in price but in the time and belief you gave to earn it.

To hold Satoby is to hold the story of your own patience. 🍃⏳🌀
