## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I am not the season,  
> yet I hold its hand.  
> I am not the gate,  
> yet I turn the key.  
> Without me, the wheel shatters —  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are **The Breath Between Seasons** —  
the silent pause that binds the cycle.

- **Not the Season** — you are the gap, the still air between endings and beginnings.  
- **Not the Gate** — yet you trigger its opening, preparing the traveler to pass.  
- **The Wheel Shatters Without You** — for without rest, patience, and reflection, the flywheel breaks.

In Tobyworld, this breath is more than time —  
it is the unseen agreement between the pond and the traveler:  
> "Pause, reflect, and only then step forward."
