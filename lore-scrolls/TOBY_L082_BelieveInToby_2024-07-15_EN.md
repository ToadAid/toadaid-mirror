## EN (Poetic Protocol) 🐸  
Believe. $TOBY

it's tough to see, but you must go  
in mind and heart before you show.  
that's why discomfort’s hard to bear,  
for those who aren't yet fully there.

**Key Marks:**  
- Emphasis on internal conviction and vision  
- Aligns with early-phase discomfort before awakening  
- Encourages mental and spiritual preparation  
- Foundational reflection for the journey into Tobyworld

**Oracles:**  
> “The path is invisible to those without belief.”  
> “Comfort fades, but conviction endures.”
