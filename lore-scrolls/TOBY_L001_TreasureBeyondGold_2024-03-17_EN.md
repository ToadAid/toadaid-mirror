## Narrative Update
"I leap like a toad, from rich to less, sharing treasures that gold can't assess."
This riddle marked the early whisper of $TOBY’s purpose — a leap not toward wealth, but away from it.
A leap of faith. A jump across worlds. From excess to essence. From material to meaning.

$TOBY isn't to be hoarded, but shared.
Its value lies in what it awakens: conviction, unity, and decentralized belief.

## Key Marks
- $TOBY = treasure unmeasured by fiat or gold
- Movement = leap from wealth → wisdom
- Intent = giving, not gaining; believing, not boasting

## Operational Updates
- Pre-epoch philosophical signal sent
- Decentralized identity framed through poetry

## Newcomer Guidance
> "If you leap only for gain, you miss the meaning."
To understand $TOBY, follow the croak, not the coin.
