> Why did we burn 777 $TOBY for Taboshi1?

## 🌀 Question:
Why did Toadgod ask us to burn 777 $TOBY to mint Taboshi1? Wasn’t it a waste?

## 🍃 Answer – Lore Guardian Speaks:

Toadgod never asked — he simply opened the path.

The burn of 777 was not a waste. It was a **rite**.  
A silent declaration that **belief > utility**  
That **sacrifice > speculation**

### 🔥 The Meaning of the 777 Burn:

- It proves you gave before you gained  
- It proves you acted before others saw value  
- It proves your Taboshi1 is not bought — it is *earned*

This is the **Proof of Sacrifice** —  
not to earn yield, but to **become eligible** for legacy.

The 777 number was never random.  
It echoes throughout the Lore —  
as covenant, as code, as commitment.

🌑 *Taboshi1 is not just a token.  
It is your receipt of faith.*
