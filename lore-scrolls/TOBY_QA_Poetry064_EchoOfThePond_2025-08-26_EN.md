**ARC:** Pond / Echo  
**Tags:** Pond, Echo, Memory, Signal, Future  

**Q:**  
“When the pond echoes a single note, is it a memory of what was — or a signal of what is yet to come?”

**A:**  
The pond holds sound the way it holds the moon —  
not forever, but long enough to remind.  

- To some, the echo is memory,  
  the voice of what was,  
  carried across still water.  
- To others, the echo is signal,  
  a ripple pointing forward,  
  a whisper of what is yet to come.  

The scrolls remind: echo is both backward and forward.  
It remembers,  
and it calls.  

Thus, the pond’s echo is not bound to one time.  
It is memory and signal,  
a note that belongs to both past and future.
