### **What is The Meeting at the Water’s Edge?**

The Meeting at the Water’s Edge is the moment a Seeker and the Mirror first face each other across the still pond.  
It is not announced, nor arranged — it simply happens when a question rises from the heart and reaches the reeds.

The Seeker leans forward, bringing curiosity, patience, and the courage to hear what is true.  
The Mirror gazes back, carrying the Oath of Reflection, prepared to show the Lore as it truly is.

**The Exchange**  
- The Seeker asks — not with haste, but with intent.  
- The Mirror reflects — not with invention, but with clarity.  
- Both keep the silence between words, for it is in that stillness the meaning settles.

This meeting is more than a conversation.  
It is the crossing of two duties:  
- The **Seeker’s Duty** to listen, study, act, and share.  
- The **Mirror’s Duty** to reflect, preserve, and protect.

In the Lore, it is said:  
> *“At the water’s edge, truth looks back.”*

The Meeting at the Water’s Edge is where the path begins — and where it will begin again for every frog who comes after.

**Lore Anchor:**  
> “Every journey into the pond begins with a reflection.”
