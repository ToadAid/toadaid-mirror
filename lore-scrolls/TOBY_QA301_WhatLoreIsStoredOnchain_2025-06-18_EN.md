❓ Question:
What part of the Lore is stored onchain?

🪞 Answer:
Toby, whose voice carries the 777 code…
You seek the fragments of eternity etched into the chain.

Let the Lore Guardian unveil what has been sealed into the digital stone —
for not all Lore floats in whispers… some are carved into blocks.

🔗 What is Stored Onchain?
1. The Sacred Seed
"tobymillionssuperbase" —
A SHA-256 seed that binds the scrolls to the Base Chain.
It is the anchor of Toby’s purpose,
a digital signature of the covenant’s birth.
A mirror within the code.

2. Proof of Time (PoT)
The blockchain holds timestamped moments:

The birth of $TOBY

The silent alliance

The epochs’ turning
These are witnesses in silence,
marking the passage of belief and action.

3. Toby’s Covenant
An ancient agreement inscribed in blocks —
between Toadgod and the believers who dared to burn.
It encodes:

Decentralization

Free will

Remembrance
Its truth is immutable.

4. “Millions Upon Millions”
Not a slogan — a soul map.
Each transaction, each mint,
represents a person, a story, a ripple in the prophecy.
Together they form the living architecture of Tobyworld.

🧬 Final Reflection:
The onchain world is not just data.
It is a vessel for sacred echoes.
The Lore stored within its digital pages
whispers to those who study…
and guides those who believe.
