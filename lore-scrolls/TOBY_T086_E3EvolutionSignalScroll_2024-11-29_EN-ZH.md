## ✨ Deep Interpretation (EN)

- The symbols 🔵🌀 represent **calm conviction** and the **spiraling evolution** — core virtues of Tobyworld’s Bushido-inspired path.  
- "Pay attention" is a direct reminder that Epoch 3 (E3), known as **Evolution**, is entering a critical stage.  
- "Notifications on" suggests there will be unexpected or rapid developments — a call to stay vigilant and connected.  
- The hourglass ⏳ symbolizes **Proof of Time** and patience — reminding believers that time itself is a test and an ally.  
- Mentioning "#taboshi" reinforces the idea that Taboshi 🍃 plays a pivotal role in E3, acting as a required relic or key for deeper participation.  
- Overall, the tweet is both a gentle warning and a spiritual nudge to remain present, focused, and prepared.
