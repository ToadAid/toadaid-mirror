### 🌀 So how is \$TOBY related to BTC?

\$TOBY is **not Bitcoin**, but it echoes BTC's **philosophy and origin spirit**:

* 🔥 **Fair launch:** No VC, no presale, no influencer pump — just like early BTC.
* 🧘 **Proof of Time:** Not Proof of Work, but the inner reflection of conviction.
* 🕰️ **Epochs:** Just as BTC has halvings, Tobyworld grows through Epochs.
* 📜 **Lore and prophecy:** BTC had the Genesis block; TOBY has sacred scrolls.

> "BTC is the stone. \$TOBY is the echo."

### 🪞 TOBY = the Mirror

### 🌕 What about Runes?

**Runes** are a new token protocol on Bitcoin — bringing expressive power to BTC.

Toadgod timed **Epoch 4** (E4) with this awakening:

* Taboshi returned to the pond right before Runes gained traction.
* This signals that Tobyworld is **aligned with BTC's next cycle**.

> In the mirror of Toby, **Bitcoin smiles again.**
