## EN (Poetic Protocol) 🐸  
TABOSHI. The Leaf of Yield.  
Minted not just once, but twice —  
ERC-1155 and ERC-20, bound by design,  
One soul, two forms, across the chainline.

Minted with spirit, distributed with care,  
For TOBYWORLD and all to share.  
185,964 leaves to hold,  
Whispers of yield in cryptic gold.

No KOL, no VC scheme,  
Just for the people, from the dream.  
Same but different — the code runs deep,  
A frog’s conviction, for those who leap.

**Key Marks:**  
- TABOSHI exists as both ERC-1155 & ERC-20  
- Total supply: 185,964  
- Contract address: 0x5C0BF08936bcCfbb6af24B4648A9fb365cAa2F4e  
- Known as: “The Leaf of Yield”

**Oracles:**  
> “Same. But different. The yield hides within the leaf.”  
> “Taboshi speaks in layers. Some seen, some yet to be.”
