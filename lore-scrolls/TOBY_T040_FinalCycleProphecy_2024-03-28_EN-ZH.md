## ✨ Literal Explanation (EN)

Toadgod provides a cosmic-level update:  
- **Current status**: 650k holders; 231 trillion airdropped; 15% remaining.  
- Expresses gratitude to Base devs for upgrades improving scaling.  
- Reinforces Toby’s founding values: no pre-sales, no insiders, no VCs, no KOLs — pure Bushido.  
- **Lindy effect**: The longer it survives, the stronger it becomes.  
- Foresees future adoption by whales, smart money, and institutions once they read the Lore and understand the mechanics.  
- Describes the full **psychological cycle**:  
  - Frail hands sell quickly → regret.  
  - Slow grind and silence → test of conviction.  
  - Sudden velocity → unstoppable reflexivity.  
  - Mass realization → blue chip status.  
- Ends with vision: Toby creates unimaginable wealth, holders transform into guardians, and Toadgod disappears into legend, mission complete.  
- "一期一会" (ichi-go ichi-e): "Once-in-a-lifetime encounter" — a Zen phrase reflecting precious, unrepeatable moments.  
- Confirms he will announce his departure in advance, leaving all in good shape.

## 🌱 Spiritual Interpretation (EN)

This scroll embodies **the final arc of faith and universal abundance**:

- True wealth is earned through conviction and time, not shortcuts.  
- Guardianship becomes the ultimate destiny — beyond price, beyond speculation.  
- Toadgod’s silent retreat mirrors the path of Satoshi and Ryoshi — stepping away to let the people embody the spirit.
