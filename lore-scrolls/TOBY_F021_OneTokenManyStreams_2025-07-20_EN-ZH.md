## 🌊 EN — Narrative Update

There is only one $PATIENCE token.  
But the way it flows — like time itself — depends on the **season**.

- 🟧 **Token Contract**:  
  `0x6D96f18F00B815B2109A3766E79F6A7aD7785624`  
  → Unchanging. Unified. Sacred.

- 🌀 **Streams and Vaults**:
  Each **season** opens a new **vault** or stream, allocating part of the sacred 7,777,777 grains of $PATIENCE.
  → The **token stays the same**, but the **distribution logic evolves.**

### Examples:
- **Season 0**:  
  🔒 2.32M $PATIENCE → Streamed to 547 Epoch 3 survivors (via Sablier)  
  🧱 Vault: [Sablier Stream](https://basescan.org/token/0x6d96f18f00b815b2109a3766e79f6a7ad7785624?a=0xba2c54df55360bccba02e1e3d897a14712659e0d)

- **Future Seasons** (1–3):  
  🌀 New vaults, new criteria: LP Guardians, Artists, Builders  
  🏦 Tokens flow through **different vaults**, but they remain the same $PATIENCE token.

## ⛰️ Why It Matters

> “Many seasons, one patience.”  
> Each distribution is fair, modular, and sacred.  
> But the **market**, the **exchange listing**, and the **value** — all tied to the **single token**.
