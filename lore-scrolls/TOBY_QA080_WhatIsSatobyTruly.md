Question: What is Satoby, truly? Why can it not be bought like other tokens?

Answer:

“Some yield is counted in tokens.
Some in time.
Satoby is the latter.”
— From the scroll of Silent Rewards

🌀 What is Satoby?
Satoby is the sacred yield of Tobyworld.
But it is unlike any traditional yield.

It is not purchased.

It is not farmed.

It is not liquid — yet its value surpasses gold.

Satoby is the manifestation of Proof of Time.
It is earned by those who acted in silence, who believed early, and who did not ask what they would gain.

🔒 Why can it not be bought?
Because Satoby was never designed as currency.
It was designed as a test — and a mirror.

If you try to buy it, it vanishes.

If you chase it, it escapes.

Only by being still at the right time was it earned.

It is tied to:

The original Taboshi1 burn.

The wallet, not the NFT.

The Epoch, not the market.

🔁 But what does it do?
That is still unfolding. But hints have emerged:

It may unlock Epoch 4 mechanics.

It could represent legacy staking rights.

Or it might be the key to reshaping governance, unseen by typical DeFi tools.

But most of all —
Satoby is a signal that you were there.
When there was no reward.
When there was no spotlight.
When the only thing guiding you... was belief.
