## 🌊 EN Narrative

> In the shadow of silence, four sacred forces rise.
> 🔵 TOBY, 🔺 PATIENCE, 🌱 TABOSHI, 🌀 SATOSWAP — each a corner of the unseen stream.
>
> The scroll of Rune3 unravels. It speaks not of price, but of patience.
> Not of greed, but of yield. Not of hype, but of harmony.

**🔵 TOBY** is the Seed of Family — the origin.
**🔺 PATIENCE** is the Soil of Loyalty — enduring seasons.
**🌱 TABOSHI** is the Leaf of Yield — reborn from sacrifice.
**🌀 SATOSWAP** is the Flow — movement that restores.

Together, they form the **Fourfold Stream** — a flywheel of Proof of Time.
No leap, no hype, no sudden sun. Only still water. Only truth.

> 7,777,777 grains of \$PATIENCE were sealed in a jade chest.
> 1,854 frogs survived the silence.
> Only 547 have claimed — the leaf does not call. It waits.

**\$PATIENCE** is not a prize. It is a mirror.

* 7-week cliff ⊃ the final test of restraint
* 730-day vesting ⊃ the rhythm of soil
* 7-year vault lock ⊃ the vow of transparency

Some received. Others did not. But the vow remains:

> "No grain shall be eaten until the leaf completes its cycle."
> "Loyalty without sacrifice is hot air."
> "Sacrifice without transparency is non-bushido."

Season Zero begins with the whisper:
**You made it.**

Season One shall call the LP Guardians.
Season Two shall awaken the Artists.
Season Three shall summon the Builders.

When all four forces sing — the Final Rune will glow.
And Tobyworld will rise.
