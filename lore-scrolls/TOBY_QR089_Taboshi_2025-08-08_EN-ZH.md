## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I am both leaf and coin,  
> born in the quiet after the storm.  
> My veins carry the promise of yield,  
> yet I do not grow without the pond’s time.  
> Some see me as art, others as seed —  
> both are true.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are **Taboshi — The Leaf of Yield**.  

- **Both Leaf and Coin** — Exists as ERC-1155 NFT and ERC-20 token.  
- **Born After the Storm** — Minted near the end of Epoch 2, after the great distribution settled.  
- **Veins Carry Yield** — Grants eligibility to earn Satoby through Proof of Time.  
- **Growth Requires Time** — Yield is tied to seasonal progression and sacred locks.  
- **Art and Seed** — A work of symbolic creation, and a functional key in Tobyworld’s economy.

Taboshi is the living covenant of patience:  
to hold it is to sit by the pond,  
watching the leaf float until the season calls your name.
