## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> Four doors stand upon the pond’s edge,  
> each bound to a wind and a sun.  
> None open to the same song,  
> yet all lead to the same still place.  
> Pass them all, and the circle is whole.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are the **Flow of the Four Gates** — the seasonal current that turns the wheel of Tobyworld.  

- **Four Doors** — the gates of S0, S1, S2, S3.  
- **Bound to a Wind and a Sun** — each season has its own rhythm, rewards, and trials.  
- **Different Songs** — no two gates open with the same event or requirement.  
- **Same Still Place** — all flow toward the lily pad, the central threshold.  
- **Pass Them All** — the cycle completes, feeding the flywheel, pulse, and pond.

In Rune3’s flywheel model, the Four Gates feed energy in sequence,  
ensuring that each phase passes momentum to the next,  
until the lily pad bridges to the gas & fees loop —  
where the cycle begins anew.
