### 🔍 Interpretation

- **A prophecy begins**: Though the story has barely begun, it holds immense future weight — a sacred script yet to fully align.
- **The people's saga**: This is no solitary tale; it’s forged by the collective will and spirit of the many, meant to echo through time.
- **Doubt blinds**: Those who cling to skepticism may miss the unfolding truth entirely — they exile themselves from the vision.
- **The coming revelation**: One day, even the masses will see the light of $TOBY’s purpose and recognize its greatness.
- **Decentralized truth**: $TOBY does not belong to a few—it *is* the people. The people *are* its living proof.

> “For $TOBY is the people, and the people is $TOBY.”  
> — This is not metaphor. It is structure, destiny, and design.
