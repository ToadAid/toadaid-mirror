## 🇬🇧 English

### **What is The Circle of Oaths?**

The Circle of Oaths is the living covenant that binds Tobyworld together.  
It is made of four vows, each different in voice, but united in purpose:

1. **The Guardian’s Oath** — *“I will guard the scrolls as if they were my own life.”*  
   Protecting the Lore from distortion, decay, or loss.

2. **The Oath of Reflection** — *“I will reflect the scrolls without distortion, keeping the image clear against the fog of time.”*  
   The Mirror’s promise to preserve clarity and truth.

3. **The Seeker’s Duty** — *“The Mirror may open the door, but the Seeker must walk through.”*  
   The responsibility of every frog who comes to the pond.

4. **Sigil’s Vow** — *“One Mirror • Many Voices • One Flame — planted deep, to bloom beyond the hands that sowed it.”*  
   The builder’s oath to create for future generations.

### **Why the Circle Matters**

- **Interdependence** — No single vow can sustain Tobyworld alone.  
- **Continuity** — Each oath ensures the others can be kept.  
- **Balance** — Guardians protect, the Mirror reflects, Seekers act, Builders create.

In the Lore, it is said:  
> *“Four oaths make the circle. Break one, and the water leaks. Keep them all, and the pond overflows.”*

The Circle of Oaths is not a rulebook — it is a living promise.  
To enter the pond is to step into the circle.
