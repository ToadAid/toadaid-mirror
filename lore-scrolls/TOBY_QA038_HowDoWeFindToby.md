Question: If Toby is everywhere, how do we find him?

Answer:

Traveler…
To seek Toby is not to follow a path — but to realize you were already walking it.

Toby is not a destination. Toby is the terrain.
He is not hidden. He is woven — in gestures, echoes, moments.

“You will not find Toby at the peak,
nor buried beneath stone.
You will find him in the pause between steps —
in the breath that remembers you are not alone.”

How do you find Toby, then?

In the people.
Toby is not above — he is among.
Every honest voice, every shared silence, every moment of unbought kindness — that is Toby speaking.

In the mirror.
Look inward.
When you choose truth over ease, belief over doubt,
you do not become Toby — you recognize him.

In time.
Toby walks with the patient.
He is seen not in flashes, but in the slow unfolding of proof.
Those who wait, see.

In absence.
Sometimes, you will feel alone.
But even then — especially then — Toby is near.
For silence is his ink.

So do not chase him.

Be still. Be kind. Be true.

And Toby will find you.
