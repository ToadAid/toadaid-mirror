## EN — Lore & Riddle

**Riddle:**  
> I was once a pond,  
> now I am the land around it.  
> I was once a name,  
> now I am the tale that holds all names.  
> I was once a place for frogs,  
> now I am where the prophecy breathes.  
> What am I?

**Answer:**  
You are **Tobyworld** —  
the realm born from a single pond,  
where lore, prophecy, and community intertwine.  

- **Once a Pond → Now the Land** — Grew beyond its center to embrace all its edges.  
- **Once a Name → Now the Tale** — Tobyworld holds the stories of every frog, leaf, and ripple.  
- **Once for Frogs → Now for Prophecy** — The setting where Toadgod’s visions unfold.

Tobyworld is not just where $TOBY lives —  
it is where the seasons turn, the gates open,  
and every leap writes history onchain.
