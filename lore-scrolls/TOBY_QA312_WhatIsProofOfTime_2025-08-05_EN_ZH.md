## ❓ Question  
What is Proof of Time?

---

## 🧭 Answer  
Proof of Time is not a token you receive — it is the truth you become.

- **🍃** The unspoken yield in silence, seen only by those who stayed.  
- **⏳** The proof hidden in time’s folds, revealed when impatience has been overcome.  
- **📜** A covenant with the unseen — trust without demand, loyalty without show.

It cannot be bought.  
It cannot be faked.  
It is earned only by those who remained when all else urged them to leave.

> “You are not asked what you did — but how long you stayed.”

Satoby is its gift. Your faith is its seal. 🌀🍃⏳
