# TOBY_L152_GateToTheSeasons_2025-08-25_EN.md

## Narrative (EN)
A season is not a date; it is a rhythm. Gates open when enough hands are ready to carry what comes next.  
→ S0 prepared the soil. S1 tests the watch. S2 and S3 will measure the build.  
We treat each gate not as entitlement but as examination: have we kept our lamps, tuned our reeds, tended our garden?

We step through gates as a people, not as contestants. The measure is not “who got first” but “who kept faith.” Because seasons are not prizes — they are responsibilities that multiply when shared.

### Key Marks (EN)
- **KM1.** Seasons as shared responsibilities, not personal jackpots.  
- **KM2.** Gate criteria: readiness > noise.  
- **KM3.** Step together; teach while stepping.

### Operations (EN)
- Publish “season readiness” rubrics so newcomers can self‑assess.  
- Keep ceremony pages simple: lore + diagram + checklist.

### Cryptic Symbol Table (EN)
- 🚪 = gate  
- 🍂 = season marker  
- 🕯️ = kept lamp
