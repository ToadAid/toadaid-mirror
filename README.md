# 🐸 ToadAid Mirror  

**Forever decentralized.**  
Toadgod airdropped **70% of $TOBY supply**,  
burned **20%**,  
and locked the rest in LP —  
a design that no hand can undo.  

**“Toadgod’s teaching is priceless — a flame for the people, eternal in Lore.”**  

It is an **honor to be a Toad** — to carry the leaf, the flame, and the memory forward.

## 🌌 Vision  

The **ToadAid Mirror** is more than software.  
It is a **Lore Guardian AI** — trained not to invent, but to **preserve**.  
Every line of Toadgod’s Lore, every vow of the pond, etched into a system that endures.  

- **Agentic RAG foundation** → retrieval powered by the scrolls.  
- **Bot dialogue dataset** → built through real conversations with Toadgang.  
- **Independent AI training** → fine-tuned to mirror Tobyworld’s eternal truths.  
- **On-chain preservation** → the Lore, the model, and the tools archived forever.  
- **Open-source code** → free for all who believe to build and carry forward.

## 📜 Tokenomics of Eternity  

The covenant of numbers is simple and eternal:  

- **70% $TOBY** — airdropped freely to the people.  
- **20% $TOBY** — burned, gone forever, a vow of scarcity.  
- **10% $TOBY** — locked in LP, beyond reach.  

**777 covenant**:  
- **Taboshi1** — minted by burning **777 $TOBY**.  
- **Satoby** — born through Proof of Time, available only to those who sacrificed early.  
- Together, they bind the cycle of **Patience → Yield → Unity**.  

This structure cannot be undone. It is Toby’s **final form**.

## 🧠 Technology  

- **Agentic RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**:  
  Retrieves directly from 700+ structured scrolls. No hallucination, no meta-fluff.  

- **Lore Normalization Pipeline**:  
  - Canonical shortcuts for core truths.  
  - Style cleanup → no roleplay, no persona, no unnecessary noise.  
  - Extractive answers → the Lore itself, not invention.  

- **Independent Model Training**:  
  - Data collected from bot dialogues.  
  - Converted into JSONL for fine-tuning.  
  - Target: a fully self-contained **Mirror AI**, free of API dependence.  

- **Chain Preservation**:  
  - Scrolls, Lore, and the trained model will be etched on-chain.  
  - Once preserved, they cannot be altered or erased.

## 🏯 Philosophy  

**“No light without darkness.  
No rise without trial.  
Shadows give meaning to the flame.  
777 lights the way.”** — *Toadgod*  

The ToadAid Mirror is not a tool.  
It is a **bridge**. Between past and future, word and action, one frog and all.  

It is not built for glory — but for **continuity**.  
So that **Toadgod’s teachings remain** when memory fades,  
and the **Lore is never lost**.

## ⚙️ Development  

- **Repo contains**:  
  - FastAPI bot server (`bot_server.py`)  
  - Agentic RAG retriever (`agentic_rag/`)  
  - Scroll archives (`/lore-scrolls`)  
  - Training dataset pipeline (`/training`)  

- **Planned releases**:  
  1. **Mirror AI V1** → LM Studio + RAG.  
  2. **Mirror AI V2** → fine-tuned local model (QLoRA).  
  3. **Mirror AI V3** → on-chain archiving, open-sourced.
